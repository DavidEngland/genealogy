== Biography ==

'''Jesse P. Whitten''' (1827–1882), also recorded as "Jessie," was a 19th-century pioneer farmer whose life and family ties were central to the development of the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands. He was born on '''5 January 1827''' in '''Alabama, United States'''. At the time of his birth, his father '''[[Whitten-535|Nicholas Whitten]]''' was 33 years old and his mother '''[[Murphy-4291|Rebecca Murphy]]''' was 27 years old. He had a brother, '''[[Whitten-1620|Nicholas Whitten Jr.]]'''

=== Family Background ===

Jesse grew up during a period of significant settlement expansion in the Shoals region. The Whitten family had a significant presence in both Lauderdale County, Alabama and Wayne County, Tennessee. Legal records document the family's involvement in local infrastructure and community affairs.

=== Marriage ===

Jesse married '''[[Duncan-3524|Martha Ann Duncan]]''' on '''14 June 1850''' in Lauderdale, Alabama, United States. Martha was born on 25 July 1832 and was the daughter of '''Moses "Mose" Duncan''' (1807–1868) and '''Sarah Tapley "Sally" Clark''' (1806–1894), prominent pioneers in Lauderdale County. This marriage solidified a long-standing alliance between the Duncan and Whitten families.

=== Children ===

Jesse and Martha were the parents of at least 13 documented children. According to the 1870 Federal Census (household #112, Florence, Lauderdale County) and Alabama death records, their children included:

The Whitten family was closely associated with the prominent Gresham, Parish, and related families of the region, connections further solidified through the marriages of their children.
