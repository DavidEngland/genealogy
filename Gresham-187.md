== Biography ==

'''Thomas Gresham''' (10 December 1761 – 1816) was a seminal figure in the early American frontier, recognized as the '''first white settler in Lauderdale County, Alabama''', and a veteran of the Revolutionary War who endured the hardships of Valley Forge. He represents the generation of frontier pioneers who transformed the wilderness of the upper South into established settlements while simultaneously navigating the treacherous politics of Native American relations and territorial conflict.

=== Early Life and Family Origins ===

Thomas Gresham was born on '''10 December 1761''' in '''Amherst County, Virginia''', the son of '''George Gresham''' (c. 1740–1818) and '''Elizabeth Watts''' (c. 1745–1842).

==== Correction of Historical Genealogies ====

For generations, older genealogies incorrectly identified '''William Gresham''' of Spotsylvania/Amherst/Halifax (son of Thomas d. 1741 and Mary Gresham) as the father of Thomas, George, and Benjamin Gresham—the three brothers who each married Thornton sisters. However, '''Y-DNA evidence from the FTDNA Big Y project''' has definitively disqualified this connection, confirming instead that Thomas Gresham and his brothers descended from '''George Gresham''' (c. 1740–1818).

The DNA results confirm that the Gresham line is '''Haplogroup R-M269''', distinct from the Titsey line, and represents a separate patrilineal descent [6-8]. This breakthrough resolves decades of genealogical confusion and establishes the correct paternal lineage for frontier settlers across Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, and Tennessee.

==== The Watts and Kauffman Heritage ====

Thomas's mother, '''Elizabeth Watts''' (c. 1745–1842), brought distinguished colonial ancestry. She was the daughter of '''Thomas Watts Jr.''' and '''Mary Kauffman'''. The Watts line traces back through:
* '''Thomas Watts Sr.''' (c. 1680 – before 1744)
* '''William Watts''' (d. before 1704), an early colonial settler

This lineage represents a deep colonial foundation in Virginia, establishing Thomas within the settler gentry of the early American republic.

=== The Thornton Strategic Alliance ===

A remarkable feature of George Gresham's family is the deliberate kinship network created through marriage. '''Three of George's sons—Thomas, George Jr., and Benjamin—all married daughters of William Thornton''', establishing strong family ties that would facilitate frontier settlement and mutual support [4, 10].

Thomas married '''Mary Thornton''' (c. 1773–1823) on an unspecified date, but the marriage is documented in '''1793 in Oglethorpe County, Georgia'''. This union connected Thomas to one of the prominent families of the Georgia frontier and established kinship ties that would support his subsequent ventures into Kentucky and Alabama.

=== Revolutionary War Service and Valley Forge ===

At the exceptionally young age of '''15''', Thomas enlisted in the '''Continental Army''' in 1776. He served as a '''Private''' in '''Captain Robert Powell's Company''', within the '''3rd Virginia Regiment''', commanded by [[Marshall-229|Colonel Thomas Marshall]] and '''Lieutenant Colonel William Heth'''.

His military service is most notably marked by his presence at '''Valley Forge during the brutal winter of 1777–1778''' under the command of '''General George Washington'''. The 3rd Virginia Regiment entered Valley Forge with 309 men assigned and only 71 fit for duty, a stark testament to the conditions soldiers faced. During his time there, Thomas endured the freezing temperatures, disease, and starvation that characterized that infamous encampment.

Thomas was '''discharged on February 14, 1778''', but records from that time specifically note that he was '''in the hospital during his discharge''', underscoring the severe conditions and toll that Valley Forge took on its soldiers. For his service to the Continental Army, Thomas received a '''land grant in Kentucky''', a common form of compensation for Revolutionary War veterans.

=== Westward Migration: A Multi-Decade Frontier Journey ===

Thomas Gresham's journey west was not a simple relocation but rather a multi-decade endeavor characterized by persistence in the face of frontier conflict, hostile Native Americans, and shifting territorial boundaries.

'''First Attempt (c. 1800):''' Around 1800, at approximately 39 years of age, Thomas set out to claim his Kentucky land grant. However, he was forced to abandon his plan when he encountered '''intense Indian hostility'''. Rather than proceeding to Kentucky, he stopped and settled in '''Lawrence County, Tennessee''', where he remained for several years.

'''Alabama Venture (prior to 1814):''' Before 1814, Thomas made another attempt to move further south into '''Alabama'''. This move coincided with increased tensions in the region. However, '''Indian resistance''' again drove him back into '''Tennessee'''. During this period, the '''U.S. Army was actively removing white settlers from Doublehead's Reserve''', though many settlers, including Thomas, would eventually return to rebuild after the army withdrew.

'''Final Settlement (1816):''' In 1816, Thomas finally established a permanent settlement in '''Alabama''', at approximately 55 years of age. He was granted '''160 acres of land by Congress''', a testament to his status as a Revolutionary War veteran and frontier settler. This homestead was located along '''Blue Water Creek''', situated between the modern-day communities of '''Green Hill (Greenhill)''' and '''Lexington''', near the Tennessee state line in what became '''Lauderdale County, Alabama'''. This location placed him in one of the most strategically important and contested regions of the frontier.

=== Cherokee Relations and the Doublehead Petition ===

Thomas Gresham lived during a volatile period of Cherokee resistance and territorial negotiation. He was a '''signer of the Doublehead petition''' against the removal of white settlers from lands of the '''Doublehead Reserve'''. The petition was dated in '''December 1810''' and was sent to '''Washington D.C.''' as a formal protest by settlers who were being displaced from Indian lands. The locale of these petitioners appears to have been in present-day '''Lauderdale County, Alabama'''.

Furthermore, Thomas is listed in the '''1811 Census of the Alabama Territory''' as living on '''Indian Land''', indicating that despite the official designation of Cherokee territory, settlers like Thomas were actively establishing farms and homesteads within the reserve.

Thomas's role in the Doublehead petition and his persistence in settling on Cherokee lands demonstrate his agency as a frontier settler, though it also reflects the broader pattern of white encroachment that would eventually lead to the removal of Native Americans from the region.

=== Settlement and Family Life ===

'''Marriage:''' Thomas married '''Mary Thornton''' in '''1793 in Oglethorpe County, Georgia'''. This marriage connected him to the Thornton family, establishing kinship ties that would support his frontier ventures.

'''Name Variation:''' Both Thomas and Mary are buried in '''Gresham Cemetery''' on Blue Water Creek near '''Green Hill (Greenhill), Lauderdale County, Alabama'''. Notably, the surname on their headstones is spelled '''Grisham''', not Gresham. Family tradition holds that '''many rebels during the Revolutionary War changed the spelling of their surnames to distinguish themselves from Loyalist (Tory) relatives'''. This deliberate name variation—Gresham/Grisham—appears throughout this family line and reflects the deep political divisions of the Revolutionary era [2, 17].

'''Children:''' Thomas and Mary had '''ten children''':

: 1.  '''John Gresham''' (b. 1794 in Oglethorpe County, Georgia)
: 2.  '''George Gresham''' (b. 10 December 1796)
: 3.  '''Thomas Gresham Jr.''' (b. 4 June 1798 in Wilkes County, Georgia)
: 4.  '''Philemon Gresham''' (b. 17 April 1800 in Wilkes County, Georgia; d. 13 August 1850, buried Gresham Cemetery, Lauderdale County, Alabama) – married '''Delila''' (b. 19 November 1805; d. 3 March 1877)
: 5.  '''Jarred Gresham''' (b. circa 1800 in Wilkes County, Georgia)
: 6.  '''Benjamin C. Gresham''' (b. 1802 in Wilkes County, Georgia)
: 7.  '''James Gresham''' (b. 1804 in Wilkes County, Georgia)
: 8.  '''Elizabeth Gresham''' (b. 1805 in Wilkes County, Georgia)
: 9.  '''William B. Gresham''' (b. 1806 in Georgia)
: 10. '''Katherine Gresham''' (b. 1814 in Lauderdale County, Alabama)<ref>D.A.R. Lineage Book; Vol. 117, page 272</ref>

The birth locations of his children document Thomas's migration pattern: most were born in Georgia during the early 1800s, with the youngest (Katherine) born in Alabama in 1814, reflecting the family's ultimate relocation to the frontier.

=== Legacy and Descendants ===

Thomas Gresham died in '''1816''', at approximately 55 years of age, having spent only a few months in his Alabama settlement before his death. Despite his short tenure in Lauderdale County, he is recognized as the '''first white settler in the county''' and as a pioneering figure who helped establish the region for subsequent settlement.

His descendants became deeply rooted in the North Alabama and Tennessee border regions. Notably, his great-granddaughter, '''Mollie Leona Gresham''' (1874–1953), married '''William Archabald Parish''', eventually linking the Gresham line to the modern '''England''' and '''McDonald''' families of Lauderdale County, Alabama.

=== Connection to the Lewis Family ===

The Gresham family became interconnected with the prominent '''Lewis family''' of Madison County, Alabama, through both frontier settlement patterns and family marriages. The Lewis family, descended from Virginia colonial settlers with connections to George and Martha Washington's lineages, also settled in the Triana and Madison areas.

'''Edward Lewis''' (married Frances Bressie in 1763) was a Revolutionary War soldier listed in the DAR's Patriot Index, making him a contemporary and fellow patriot of Thomas Gresham. His descendants, including '''Nathaniel Lewis''' (married Sally Harris), came to Madison County in 1818—just two years after Thomas Gresham's settlement in Lauderdale County.

The parallel migration patterns of the Gresham and Lewis families—both moving from Virginia through Kentucky to the Alabama/Tennessee frontier—reflect the broader wave of Revolutionary War veterans and frontier settlers who transformed the upper South during the early 19th century.

=== Research Notes ===

'''Parentage – Corrected:''' Thomas Gresham's father is confirmed as '''George Gresham''' (c. 1740–1818) and mother as '''Elizabeth Watts''' (c. 1745–1842). For generations, genealogies incorrectly identified William Gresham of Spotsylvania as the patriarch. '''Y-DNA evidence from FTDNA Big Y''' has definitively established the correct lineage and confirmed '''Haplogroup R-M269''' [6-8, 11, 12].

'''Name Spelling:''' The variation between "Gresham" and "Grisham" reflects a deliberate choice during the Revolutionary War era to distinguish patriot families from Loyalist (Tory) relatives [2, 17].

'''Death Date:''' The exact date of death in 1816 is not documented, but it occurred shortly after his settlement in Lauderdale County, Alabama.

'''Sources of Information:''' Information derives from: the D.A.R. Lineage Book (Vol. 117, page 272); Valley Forge muster rolls; Kentucky land grant records; Alabama Territory census records of 1811; Doublehead petition records; family cemetery records; and FTDNA Big Y DNA results.

'''DNA Testing:''' If you are a Gresham male in this line, please consider doing a YDNA test at FTDNA at 111 markers and then joining the Big Y Gresham Surname Project. Progress is being made on unraveling these old Virginia lines, and your participation would be invaluable for future researchers.
