== Biography ==

'''Valentine Hargrove''' was born around '''1778''' in '''Amherst, Virginia'''. He was the son of '''John Washington Hargrove''' (age 27 at Valentine's birth) and '''Mary Ball''' (age 31 at Valentine's birth). He was an early settler on the Kentucky frontier with close connections to the influential '''Whitley family''' through his marriage to '''[[Lewis-8883|Ruth Whitley Lewis]]'''.

=== Marriage ===

Valentine married '''Ruth Whitley Lewis''' on '''9 October 1799''' in '''Lincoln County, Kentucky'''. Ruth was the daughter of '''[[Lewis-9841|Joseph Francis Lewis]]''', a skilled brickmason, and '''[[Whitley-753|Sarah Whitley]]''', sister of the famed Kentucky pioneer '''[[Whitley-757|William Chapman Whitley]]'''. The marriage was witnessed by '''Samuel Lewis''' and '''James Hardgrove'''.

=== Frontier Life and Family Narratives ===

As an early settler on the Kentucky frontier, Valentine was closely connected to the pioneering efforts of the Whitley family. Family tradition records that Valentine traveled with his brother-in-law '''William Whitley''' to Cherokee towns to secure the release of white prisoners taken during frontier conflicts. During one such peace mission, the party was threatened by warriors. Valentine reportedly demonstrated such resolve when asked if he could fight that the Indians complimented him as a '''"good warrior"''' and permitted the group to return home with several prisoners.

This account reflects Valentine's character and his participation in the dangerous and complex negotiations that characterized early frontier relations with Native American tribes.

=== Children ===

Valentine and Ruth had '''at least ten children''':

* '''Mary Hargrove'''
* '''Ruth Hargrove'''
* '''[[Hargrove-284|Elizabeth Louisiana Hargrove]]''' (1804–1862); settled in Missouri
* '''[[Hargrove-285|Samuel Ball Hargrove]]''' (b. 1806)
* '''Sarah Hargrove'''
* '''[[Hargrove-286|William Wesley Hargrove]]''' (1816–1876); died in Oregon
* '''[[Hargrove-287|James Monroe Hargrove]]''' (1818–1884); direct ancestor of the England family
* '''[[Hargrove-288|Omar Hassen Hargrove]]''' (1820–1865)
* '''[[Hargrove-290|John Lindsey Hargrove]]''' (1826–1902)
* '''[[Hargrove-291|Jackson Hargrove]]''' (b. ca. 1830)

=== Migration to Tennessee ===

Following his marriage to Ruth, Valentine and his family eventually migrated southward into the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands. This southward movement represents the broader pattern of frontier settlement expansion during the early 19th century, as settlers moved from the established Kentucky frontier into new territories.

Valentine established his home in '''Hardin County, Tennessee''', where the family resided for approximately ten years. By 1850, Valentine was living in '''Crossroads, Hardin County, Tennessee'''.

=== Military Service ===

Valentine served in the '''War of 1812''' as '''Adjutant of the 16th Regiment (Burrus') Mississippi Militia'''. The rank of Adjutant was a staff officer position requiring administrative skills and military experience, typically appointed to assist the regimental commander with paperwork, orders, and coordination. This service demonstrates his commitment to defending the frontier during this conflict with Great Britain. The Mississippi Militia played a crucial role in defending the southwestern frontier during the war, particularly in the region that would become the Tennessee-Alabama-Mississippi borderlands.

Valentine's appointment as Adjutant indicates he possessed organizational abilities and the trust of his commanding officers, as adjutants were responsible for maintaining regimental records, issuing orders, and managing communications within the regiment.

=== Legacy and Family Significance ===

Valentine's lineage proved particularly significant to the history of the Shoals area through his son '''[[Hargrove-287|James Monroe Hargrove]]''' (1818–1884) and his granddaughter '''Lydia Serena Hargrove''', whose marriage to '''James Ervin White''' linked the Hargrove family to the '''Whitten''' and '''England''' family lines. This connection established important genealogical ties between several prominent frontier families of the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands.

=== Death ===

Valentine died between '''1856 and 1860''' in '''Hardin County, Tennessee'''. Some sources indicate '''Savannah, Hardin County, Tennessee''', though this requires further verification through primary documentation.

=== Land Records ===

On 11 January 1828, Valentine (of Hardin County, Tennessee) sold '''147 acres on the waters of Fishing Creek''' in Pulaski County, Kentucky, to '''James Hargrove''' for $100; deed recorded 21 January 1828, Pulaski County Deed Book 6, p. 537.
