{{US Southern Colonist Sticker|Virginia}}

'''Mary Ball''' was born in '''1749''' in '''Henrico County, Colony of Virginia'''. She was the daughter of '''[[Ball-532|Valentine Ball]]''' (1706–1770) and '''[[Lewis-1457|Susannah Lewis]]''' (1717–1769). Her parents were married in Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County, on January 31, 1733.

=== Siblings ===

Mary was named as a legatee in her father's will, composed on January 12, 1769, and probated in '''Amherst County, Virginia''', on March 5, 1770. According to the will and family records, she was sister to:
* '''[[Ball-524|James Ball]]'''
* '''[[Ball-534|Lewis Ball]]'''
* '''[[Ball-576|John Ball]]'''
* '''[[Ball-518|William Ball]]'''
* '''[[Ball-10876|Alice (Ball) Edmonds]]''' (also recorded as Wright)
* '''[[Ball-573|Sarah (Ball) Bowman]]'''
* '''[[Ball-25263|Sarah Ball]]''' (half sibling)
* '''[[Ball-16642|Elizabeth Ball]]''' (married a Hughes)
* '''Jane Ball'''

=== Father's Estate and Will ===

Valentine Ball's will, dated '''January 12, 1769''', provides detailed insight into the distribution of his frontier estate and reveals important information about Mary's married status:

'''Primary Heirs and Major Bequests:'''
* '''Susanna Ball (Wife):''' Granted a '''life interest in the entire estate''' and served as '''Executrix''', ensuring control of the plantation during her lifetime.
* '''William Ball (Son):''' Bequeathed the '''land and plantation''' where Valentine lived, to be received after his mother's decease.
* '''Jane Ball (Daughter):''' Bequeathed '''all household goods, livestock (horses, cattle, sheep, hogs)''', and an '''enslaved man named Will''', also to be received after her mother's death.

'''Children Receiving Nominal Bequests (One Shilling Sterling Each):'''
Following standard legal practice to prevent challenges to the will, Valentine left '''one shilling sterling''' each to:
* '''James Ball'''
* '''Lewis Ball'''
* '''John Ball'''
* '''Alice Wright'''
* '''Sarah Bowman'''
* '''Susannah Heughs'''
* '''Elizabeth Heughs'''
* '''Mary Hargrove''' — '''identified as the wife of John Washington Hargrove''', confirming her married status by 1769.

'''Executors and Witnesses:'''
* '''Captain Henry Key:''' Appointed as '''Executor''' alongside Susanna Ball; bequeathed '''five shillings'''.
* '''Witnesses:''' Mary Key, Judith Tolley, and William Bishnell.

=== Marriage and Family ===

Mary married '''[[Hargrove-261|John Washington Hargrove Sr., Esq.]]''' (ca. 1750–1838). While an exact marriage date and location are not documented in available primary records, significant evidence confirms the marriage was established by '''1769''':

'''Primary Evidence:''' Mary is specifically identified as '''"Mary Hargrove"''' in her father's will dated '''January 12, 1769''', definitively confirming her married status before his death and probate on '''March 5, 1770'''.

'''Geographic Context:''' Mary was born in '''Henrico County''' (1749), but the family relocated to '''Amherst County, Virginia''' in the 1760s. Given that John Washington Hargrove Sr. was a product of the Virginia frontier and served as a '''Minuteman in Amherst County''', the marriage likely occurred in either '''Henrico''' or '''Amherst County''' during the family's tenure there.

'''Strategic Alliance:''' This union represented a pivotal '''"Hargrove Alliance,"''' merging the established '''Ball-Lewis network''' with the '''Hargrove line'''. This alliance facilitated the family's later migration to '''Pulaski County, Kentucky''', where Mary eventually died.

Her husband was a magistrate who eventually migrated with the family from Amherst and Montgomery Counties, Virginia, to the '''Kentucky frontier'''.

=== Children ===

Mary and John Washington Hargrove had a large family, including at least five sons who became prominent on the frontier:

* '''[[Hargrove-273|William Hargrove]]''' (b. 1773): A captain in the '''Indiana Rangers''' and a noted Indian fighter.
* '''[[Hargrove-274|John W. Hargrove Jr.]]''' (b. 1775): Who served as sheriff of '''Claiborne County, Tennessee''', for sixteen years.
* '''[[Hargrove-275|James B. Hargrove]]''' (b. ca. 1776).
* '''[[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]]''' (b. ca. 1778): Named for Mary's father; he was characterized as a "good warrior" who served alongside his uncle-in-law, Col. William Whitley.
* '''[[Hargrove-259|Lindsey Hargrove]]''' (b. 1780).

=== Death ===

Mary Ball Hargrove died in '''1813''', likely in '''Pulaski County, Kentucky''', where the family had established residency.

== Research Notes ==

* '''Marriage Record Gap:''' While no single marriage record (with specific date and location) has been located for Mary Ball and John Washington Hargrove Sr., the evidence of their union before 1769 is conclusive. The 1769 will of Valentine Ball remains the primary documentary proof of their established marriage during colonial Virginia. The will's specific identification of Mary as "Mary Hargrove" provides legal documentation of her married name.

* '''Washington Connection:''' While family tradition often claims a close blood tie to George Washington through the Ball family, research indicates there is '''no evidence''' to link Mary's father, Valentine Ball, to the specific Ball lineage of George Washington's mother. The connection to the Washingtons is instead more reliably traced through the '''Lewis and Warner''' intermarriages.

* '''Birth Date Correction:''' Mary was born in '''1749''', not 1780. A birth in 1780 would make her too young to be the daughter of Valentine Ball (d. 1770) or the mother of William Hargrove (b. 1773).

* '''Frontier Planter Culture:''' Valentine Ball's will illustrates '''gendered inheritance patterns''' typical of eighteenth-century Virginia frontier planters, with major real property and chattels distributed to male heirs or retained by the widow for life, while daughters received nominal bequests or household goods.
