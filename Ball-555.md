== Biography ==

'''Mary Ball''' was born in '''1749''' in '''Henrico County, Colony of Virginia'''. She was the daughter of '''[[Ball-532|Valentine Ball]]''' (1706–1770) and '''[[Lewis-1457|Susannah Lewis]]''' (1717–1769). Her parents were married in Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County, on January 31, 1733.

=== Siblings ===

Mary was named as a legatee in her father's will, composed on January 12, 1769, and probated in '''Amherst County, Virginia''', on March 5, 1770. According to the will and family records, she was sister to:
* '''James Ball'''
* '''Lewis Ball'''
* '''John Ball'''
* '''William Ball'''
* '''Alice (Ball) Wright''' (also recorded as Edmonds)
* '''Sarah (Ball) Bowman'''
* '''Susana Ball''' (married a Hughes)
* '''Elizabeth Ball''' (married a Hughes)
* '''Jane Ball'''

=== Marriage and Family ===

Mary married '''[[Hargrove-261|John Washington Hargrove Sr., Esq.]]''' (ca. 1750–1838) around '''1768''' in '''Virginia'''. Because she is identified as "Mary Hargrove" in her father's 1769 will, her marriage is confirmed to have occurred before his death. 

Her husband was a magistrate who eventually migrated with the family from Amherst and Montgomery Counties, Virginia, to the '''Kentucky frontier'''.

=== Children ===

Mary and John Washington Hargrove had a large family, including at least five sons who became prominent on the frontier:

* '''[[Hargrove-273|William Hargrove]]''' (b. 1773): A captain in the '''Indiana Rangers''' and a noted Indian fighter.
* '''[[Hargrove-274|John W. Hargrove Jr.]]''' (b. 1775): Who served as sheriff of '''Claiborne County, Tennessee''', for sixteen years.
* '''[[Hargrove-275|James B. Hargrove]]''' (b. ca. 1776).
* '''[[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]]''' (b. ca. 1778): Named for Mary's father; he was characterized as a "good warrior" who served alongside his uncle-in-law, Col. William Whitley.
* '''[[Hargrove-259|Lindsey Hargrove]]''' (b. 1780).

=== Historical Context and Legacy ===

Mary's life placed her within the "western aristocracy" of Virginia and Kentucky. Through her mother, Susannah Lewis, her family was part of an influential network that included the '''Warner and Washington''' families.

Her family was foundational to the settlement of the '''Tennessee-Alabama borderlands'''. Her son Valentine eventually settled in '''Hardin County, Tennessee''', while other descendants established themselves in '''Lauderdale County, Alabama'''. The naming of her son '''Valentine''' specifically honored her father, Valentine Ball, maintaining a strong genealogical link through subsequent generations, including her grandson '''Samuel Ball Hargrove'''.

=== Death ===

Mary Ball Hargrove died in '''1813''', likely in '''Pulaski County, Kentucky''', where the family had established residency.

== Research Notes ==

* '''Washington Connection:''' While family tradition often claims a close blood tie to George Washington through the Ball family, research indicates there is '''no evidence''' to link Mary's father, Valentine Ball, to the specific Ball lineage of George Washington's mother. The connection to the Washingtons is instead more reliably traced through the '''Lewis and Warner''' intermarriages.
* '''Birth Date Correction:''' Mary was born in '''1749''', not 1780. A birth in 1780 would make her too young to be the daughter of Valentine Ball (d. 1770) or the mother of William Hargrove (b. 1773).
