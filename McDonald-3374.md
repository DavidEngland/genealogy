== Biography ==

Thomas Anderson McDonald (1822 – 1885) was a blacksmith who represented the fourth generation of the McDonald family's tradition of technical craftsmanship in early America. While he maintained the blacksmith trade passed down through generations, he deferred to skilled relatives who practiced the more specialized gunsmith craft. He was the fourth child of [[McDonald-3121 | John McDonald]] (c. 1792–c. 1860) and [[Emory-1 | Margaret Emory]] (c. 1793–c. 1880), born at Wartrace in Bedford County, Tennessee, during a period of rapid settlement following his family's migration from South Carolina.

=== Early Life and Family Origins ===

Thomas was born in 1822 in Bedford County, Tennessee, as part of the great southern migration that brought the McDonald family from South Carolina through Tennessee and eventually to Alabama. His parents, John and Margaret Emory McDonald, had left South Carolina between 1816 and 1819 during the economic depression that drove many families westward. At the time of Thomas's birth, his father John was approximately 30 years old and his mother Margaret was approximately 29 years old.

The McDonald family was deeply rooted in Scots-Celtic heritage and the traditions of Clan Donald, one of the most powerful Highland clans of Scotland. This heritage shaped the family's values of independence, technical skill, and pioneering spirit that characterized Thomas's life and work.

=== Marriage and Settlement ===

On June 24, 1852, Thomas married Sarah A. Adkinson in Lawrence County, Tennessee. Sarah was raised on her father's plantation at Wayland Springs, Lawrence County, and the couple resided there for several years following their wedding.

Their life at Wayland Springs marked the beginning of a family that would produce ten children and contribute significantly to the settlement of both Tennessee and Alabama. Their daughter [[McDonald-4057 | Palina Altimira "Kitty" McDonald]] was born at Wayland Springs in the spring of 1859.

=== The Blacksmith Tradition and Family Connections to Gunsmithing ===

Thomas Anderson McDonald continued the family tradition of blacksmithing, a skilled trade essential to frontier communities. While other McDonald men in the family were renowned gunsmiths producing "Kentucky Rifles," Thomas focused primarily on his blacksmithing work and referred to his more skilled relatives for specialized gunsmithing tasks.

==== Family Connection to the Gun-Making Legacy ====

Thomas's involvement with gun-making was primarily through family association and community knowledge rather than personal practice. The February 1843 estate settlement of [[McDonald-1 | Ephraim B. McDonald]], a noted gunsmith at Green Hill, Alabama, shows that multiple McDonald men—Thomas's brothers Matthew, John, Elias, and Joseph—purchased Ephraim's gun-making tools. This suggests that Thomas, while primarily a blacksmith, was connected to the broader McDonald gun-making tradition through his relatives who specialized in the craft.

The McDonald brothers in this region were renowned for producing "Kentucky Rifles" that were highly valued for their:
* Accuracy and reliability
* Quality craftsmanship
* Artistic detail and finishing
* Connection to the famous Kennedy Gun Factory at Green Hill

These rifles were not merely functional tools but were considered "works of art" by contemporary standards. While Thomas maintained his own blacksmith shop, the technical skill required for gunsmithing represented the specialized expertise of his kinsmen.

=== Family Migrations and Residences ===

Thomas Anderson McDonald's life was marked by several significant relocations, following the pattern of westward expansion common to his generation:

==== Wayne County, Tennessee (c. 1860) ====

By 1860, census records show the family had moved to Wayne County, Tennessee, continuing the pattern of migration that had brought his parents from South Carolina through Tennessee.

==== Cypress Creek, Lauderdale County, Alabama (1870) ====

By 1870, Thomas and his family were living on Cypress Creek in Lauderdale County, Alabama, near Parsonage Chapel. This location placed them as neighbors to his brother, [[McDonald-2 | John Scruggs McDonald]].

Family history emphasizes that Thomas and John Scruggs were particularly close because they were "reared together on Cypress Creek." The Cypress Creek settlement represented a reunion of sorts for the McDonald clan, with multiple family members establishing farms and businesses in the area.

The Cypress Creek community featured:
* Brandon Factory (later called Embree Factory), possibly operated by relatives of Margaret Emory McDonald
* A general store operated by two Emory brothers (Margaret's relatives)
* An early railroad connecting iron ore mines at Iron City, Tennessee, to Florence, Alabama
* Railroad Methodist Church, named for this early railway

==== Cloverdale (Rawhide), Alabama (1881) ====

By 1881, the family was residing in Cloverdale (then known as Rawhide) in Lauderdale County, Alabama. This location became the setting for a memorable piece of family history.

=== The Frank and Jesse James Incident ===

In 1881, the notorious outlaws Frank and Jesse James robbed the payroll at Lock Six on the Muscle Shoals Canal. According to family stories preserved by descendants, the James gang came by Thomas Anderson McDonald's farm following the robbery.

The family account, passed down through generations, states that Thomas's son John McDonald watered and fed the outlaws' horses. This incident demonstrates both the isolation of frontier farms (where hospitality was expected) and the colorful history of the region during the post-Civil War period.

=== Children and Family Life ===

Thomas Anderson McDonald and Sarah A. Adkinson had ten children, all born in Tennessee between 1855 and 1873:

1. Corinthus A. McDonald (b. 1855)

2. Martha Finch "Mattie" McDonald (1856 – c. 1933)

3. Commodore Harry "Horry" McDonald (1857 – 1917)

4. [[McDonald-4057 | Palina Altimira "Kitty" McDonald]] (March 31, 1859 – August 5, 1936)
   * Born at Wayland Springs, Lawrence County, Tennessee
   * Married [[England-1361 | William Eldredge "Bill" England]] on November 29, 1876
   * Had eight children who established families across Alabama
   * The name "Altimira" (sometimes spelled "Altina") honored her aunt Artimena McDonald English

5. John McDonald (1861 – 1942)
   * The son who fed the James gang's horses in 1881

6. Joseph "Joe" McDonald (b. 1863)

7. William Scruggs McDonald (b. 1866)
   * Named for his uncle John Scruggs McDonald

8. Thomas Franklin "Frank" McDonald (1869 – 1953)

9. Sarah McDonald (1869)
   * Twin to Frank
   * Died in infancy

10. Fannie McDonald (b. 1873)

=== Death and Legacy ===

Thomas Anderson McDonald died in 1885 in Lauderdale County, Alabama, at the age of 63 years. He was buried in Savannah Cemetery, Savannah, Hardin County, Tennessee.

His legacy includes:
* Continuing the McDonald family's tradition of skilled craftsmanship
* Contributing to the gun-making heritage of North Alabama
* Raising a large family that helped settle and develop Lauderdale County
* Maintaining the technical skills of blacksmithing and gunsmithing on the frontier
* Connecting the Tennessee and Alabama McDonald families through his migrations

Through his daughter Palina "Kitty" McDonald, Thomas's lineage continued into the England family, producing multiple generations of Alabama farmers, conservationists, and civic leaders.

=== Research Notes for Genealogists ===

==== Surname Variations ====

Important: Researchers searching for Thomas Anderson McDonald should be aware that census-takers frequently recorded the family surname as "McDaniel" rather than "McDonald." This variation appears in:

* 1850 Lauderdale County, Alabama Census
* 1860 Lawrence County, Tennessee Census
* Various other official records

According to Celtic genealogy, McDonalds and McDaniels share common roots in the great Clan Donald, making this spelling variation historically significant rather than merely a clerical error. Family historians researching this line should search under both surnames to capture complete records.
