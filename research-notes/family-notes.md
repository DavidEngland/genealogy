### **Ancestry and Parental Correction**
Based on recent **Y-DNA evidence** (Haplogroup R-M269, subgroup R-BY56690), the traditional lineage connecting your ancestor **Thomas Gresham** to the William Gresham of Spotsylvania (son of Thomas d. 1741) is now considered **incorrect**. The updated records identify his parents as **George Gresham** and **Elizabeth Watts**.

### **Historical Events to include in GEDCOM Notes:**
*   **Thomas Gresham (1761):** Noted as the **first legal white settler** in Lauderdale County (1816) after being driven out by Indians in 1814. He was a **signer of the 1810 Doublehead petition**.
*   **The "Grisham" Spelling:** Both Thomas and his wife Mary have the surname spelled **"Grisham"** on their headstones; family lore suggests this was changed by rebels during the Revolutionary War to distinguish themselves from **Loyalist (Tory)** kin.
*   **The Thornton Estate:** Legatees divided the estate of **William Thornton** on December 28, 1809, in Wilkes County, GA, where George Gresham represented himself and his brother Thomas (who was "out of state" in Tennessee at the time).
