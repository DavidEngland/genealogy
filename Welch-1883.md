== Biography ==

'''Elijah C. Welch''' was born in 1810 in Hopkins County, Kentucky, to [[Welch-1890|Lewis Welch]] and an unknown mother. He settled in Hardin County, Tennessee, where he farmed and raised his family.

=== Marriage and Family ===

Elijah married '''Mary Taylor''' (1801–1880), born in South Carolina. Together they had at least three children:

* [[Welch-1878|Serena Welch]] (c. 1833–1884) — married [[Hargrove-279|James Monroe Hargrove]]
* Albert S. Welch (b. 1838)
* Mary Ann Welch (b. 1848)

Through his daughter Serena's marriage to James Monroe Hargrove, Elijah's family united with the distinguished [[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]] family, fellow War of 1812 veterans who were instrumental in settling the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands.

=== Life in Tennessee ===

The 1850 Hardin County Census lists Elijah as head of household with his wife Mary and daughter Serena.<ref>"United States Census, 1850," database with images, ''FamilySearch'' (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MCDN-FWS : accessed 06 Sep 2013), Elijah C Welsh, Hardin County, Tennessee.</ref> By 1860, the household included Mary and their younger children.<ref>"United States Census, 1860," database with images, ''FamilySearch'' (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M8TD-M2Q : accessed 08 Jul 2024), Elijah Welch and Mary Welch, Hardin County, Tennessee.</ref>

=== Death ===

Elijah C. Welch died in 1867 in Hardin County, Tennessee, at age 57, during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. His wife Mary survived him by 13 years, dying in 1880 at age 79.

== Ancestry ==

Elijah was the son of [[Welch-1890|Lewis Welch]] (b. 1780 in North Carolina), who migrated to Hopkins County, Kentucky, by 1810. Lewis was the son of [[Welch-185|Nicholas Welch]] (c. 1738–1814), a Loyalist Major in the Royal British Army during the American Revolution, and [[Moore-51757|Elizabeth E. Moore]] (1740–1799).

The identity of Elijah's mother remains unknown. Researchers should examine Hopkins County, Kentucky vital records (1806–1820), land deeds, and church records for potential identification.

=== Surname Variations ===

The surname appears in records as: Welch, Welsh, Wellch, and Welshe. The 1850 census records him as "Elijah C Welsh."

== Research Notes ==

* Birth year estimated from 1850 census (age 40)
* Children Albert S. and Mary Ann documented in census records
* Mother's identity unknown — may be discoverable through Hopkins County land deeds showing women's dower rights
* War of 1812 index entries for an Elijah Welch exist but are **not verified** for this profile and conflict with his birth year
