* Family had at least 7 sons and 2 daughters documented from first marriage
* 1880 census shows residence in Justice Precinct 3, Palo Pinto, Texas
* Family appears to have been prosperous farmers and ranchers in Texas during the late 19th century; additional documentation of land holdings would strengthen profile
