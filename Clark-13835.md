== Biography ==

'''Sarah Tapley Clark''' (often recorded as "Sally" or "Aunt Sallie") was born on 23 February 1806 in Tennessee, United States, to '''Robert Clark''' (age 28 at her birth) and '''Lucy Farmer''' (age 22 at her birth). Her middle name appears in records as either '''Tapley''' or '''Tarpley'''.

On 27 March 1829, Sarah married '''Moses Duncan''' (b. ca. 1807, South Carolina) in Lauderdale County, Alabama. Moses farmed in the Florence and Oakland areas of northwest Alabama. Together they raised at least nine children (four sons, five daughters), including:
* '''Martha E. Duncan''' (b. 1832) – married '''Jesse P. Whitten''' (ancestral link to the England family)
* '''Sarah Duncan''' (b. ca. 1830) – married '''John Coates Johnson'''
* '''George Washington Duncan''' (1832–1917) – married '''Sarah Maria Smith'''
* '''James Andrew Duncan''' (1845–1926) – married '''Annie Flynt'''
* '''Elmira Duncan''' (b. ca. 1840) – married '''William C. Carothers'''
* '''Thomas J. Duncan''' (1842–1932) – death record confirms Sarah Clark as his mother
* plus additional daughters and sons noted in household records

Sarah appeared in every federal census from 1850 through 1880. In the 1880 enumeration she is listed as "Sallie Johnson" in the household of John Johnson, though she is identified elsewhere as the mother of the Duncan children.

Sarah Tapley Clark Duncan died on 6 June 1894 in Lauderdale County, Alabama, United States, at age 88, and was buried there.
