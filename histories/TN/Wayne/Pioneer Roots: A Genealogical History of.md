Pioneer Roots: A Genealogical History of the Lawson, Brewer, Scott, Martin, and Pigg Families of Wayne County, Tennessee

1. Introduction: The Wilderness Path to Middle Tennessee

The strategic migration wave into Middle Tennessee between 1810 and 1830 represents a pivotal era in the American frontier narrative. During this period, Wayne County and its immediate neighbors—Hardin, Lawrence, and Perry—served as a frontier crucible for families transitioning from the established societies of the Carolinas and Virginia. This movement was largely catalyzed by the availability of Western lands, often secured through Revolutionary War land grants that incentivized veterans and their descendants to settle the "Old Mero District."

The geographic and administrative landscape of early Wayne County was defined by its transition from a wilderness outpost to a structured community. As families like the Scotts, Brewers, and Martins moved through the Kentucky gaps into the fertile valleys of Indian Creek and 48 Mile Creek, they faced the dual challenges of establishing civic order and ensuring familial survival. This history is not merely a record of names and dates but a study of the resilience required to navigate a region where records are scarce and the environment was often unforgiving. To understand these lineages, one must first master the specific methodological hurdles presented by the region's archival history.

2. Navigating the "Burned Courthouse": Research Methodology for Wayne County

Professional genealogical research in Wayne County requires what I term a "creative imagination"—a systematic reliance on alternative evidence necessitated by the catastrophic loss of official county records. Traditional primary sources, such as deed and will books, are largely absent, forcing the historian to pivot toward state-level collections and private family archives.

The Records Landscape

Wayne County is a quintessential "burned county." While early historians noted record losses as early as 1886, a devastating fire in January 1972 (some sources cite 1973) decimated the remaining County, Circuit, and Chancery court archives. Consequently, marriage books prior to 1857 and original bonds were lost. To reconstruct these families, the historian must look to the Tennessee State Library and Archives (TSLA), which holds the "loose records" discussed in the landmark 1989 workshops, including court cases and tax lists that managed to escape the local conflagrations.

Alternative Source Evaluation

In the absence of local probate and land ledgers, we prioritize alternative record groups to establish proof of lineage and residence.

Primary Evidence (Lost)	Alternative Evidence (Extant)	Genealogical Value ("So What?")
County Court Wills	Supreme Court Records (Middle TN)	Case files like Troxler vs. Distributees of Jacob Troxler (1858) identify heirs across multiple states when local wills are missing.
Marriage Licenses	Bible Records (Record Group 483)	TSLA’s RG 483 contains microfilmed family Bibles providing exact vital dates and birth sequences.
County Court Deeds	Revolutionary War Pension Files	Applications provide detailed migration narratives and service history, often substituted for lost land proofs.
Local Land Ledgers	State Land Grants & Tax Lists	Verifies the exact timing of a family's arrival on specific waterways like 48 Mile Creek.
Circuit Court Records	Chancery Court Appeals	Detailed lists of "distributees" in estate disputes offer the most reliable window into 19th-century kinship.

This methodological framework provides the necessary evidentiary weight to document the Scott family, whose magistrates helped shape the early judicial character of the county.

3. The Scott Family: Magistrates of 48 Mile Creek

The Scott family established themselves as early civic leaders, strategically settling along the vital waterways of eastern Wayne County. Their leadership as magistrates provided the necessary stability for the burgeoning frontier community.

Lineage and Settlement

The progenitor of this line, James Scott (b. 1765, NC), and his wife Rebecca DuVal arrived in the 48 Mile Creek area between 1815 and 1820, following a migration path through Virginia and Kentucky. Their son, John Martin Scott (b. 1791, VA), became a cornerstone of local governance, serving as a Magistrate for Wayne County. He successfully filed for a 200-acre Revolutionary War tract, a claim that anchored the family’s landholdings. John Martin Scott is buried at the Jackson Cemetery in Collinwood.

Physical landmarks still echo the family’s presence; the area known as "Granny Scott Hollow" at 48 Mile Creek was named in honor of John Martin Scott’s second wife, Mary Cynthia White, who lived there with her youngest son, Frank, according to the 1880 census.

The "So What?" of Community Ties

The Scotts utilized marriage to cement their local influence, creating a localized "kinship economy." The children of John Martin Scott included:

* Samuel E. Scott (b. 1823), who married Lydia Keeton.
* Frederick Marion Scott (b. 1832).
* John James Scott (b. 1838).
* William M. Scott (b. 1839), who married Sarah Jane Pigg.
* Mary Jane Scott (b. 1842), who married William M. Pigg.
* Madison Columbus Scott (b. 1846), who married Elizabeth A. Gray.
* Isabella Scott (b. 1851), who married George W. Gray.

These unions, particularly with the Pigg family, ensured that the Scotts maintained a dominant social and economic position, much like the administrative authority exercised by the Brewer family.

4. The Brewer and Lawson Lineage: High Sheriffs and North Carolina Ties

The Brewer family, migrating from Moore County, North Carolina, quickly ascended to high-level administrative roles, most notably in the realm of law enforcement.

Family Profile

Led by Wiley Jackson Brewer and Margaret Cockman, the family produced Rial (Riley) Brewer, Esq. (1817–1862). Rial Brewer served as the High Sheriff of Wayne County during the 1850s, a role that placed him at the center of the county’s legal and fiscal operations.

Law Enforcement and Legal Records

The 1851 Circuit Court Minute Books provide substantial evidence of Rial Brewer’s official duties. His standing as a trusted administrator is quantified by his fiscal responsibility; on December 19, 1851, he was credited by Tennessee Treasurer A. Dibrell with the collection of $1,031.40 in revenue. His official actions included:

* Return of the Venirefacias: In May 1851, Rial Brewer returned the summons for the "good and lawful men" to serve as jurors, including neighbors Isham Turnbough, Andrew Jackson, and Silvester B. Lindsey.
* Legal Surety: He frequently provided security for defendants, such as Buckley Ham (indicted for tippling) and Benjamin F. Brooks (trespass), underscoring his influence in the judicial process.

The Lawson Connection

Sarah Jane Brewer, daughter of Rial Brewer and Hannah Horton, serves as the vital genealogical bridge to the Lawson family. The convergence of the Brewer and Scott lines through intermarriage represents the ancestral path for the specific Lawson descendants of this region, merging two of the county’s most administratively active lineages.

5. The Pigg Family: Overseers and Interwoven Loyalties

The Pigg family functioned as the "connective tissue" of Wayne County, managing the community's physical infrastructure while reinforcing social bonds through marital alliances with the Scotts.

Civic Responsibility

Frontier survival depended on the maintenance of roads, a duty categorized by "classes" and "hands." In June 1850, court records identify Henry Pigg as a road overseer. The court assigned local residents to work under his direction to maintain these critical transport routes, a role that required both logistical skill and local authority.

Marital Alliances and the Kinship Economy

The intermarriages between the Piggs and Scotts created a formidable economic bloc:

* Mary Jane Scott married William M. Pigg (October 1861).
* Sarah Jane Pigg married William M. Scott (1862).

These unions ensured that labor and land remained within a trusted network, effectively protecting the families' interests against the volatility of the frontier and the coming Civil War. This pattern of service and community building is mirrored in the Martin family’s contributions.

6. The Martin Family: Revolutionary Veterans and Mill Owners

The Martin family legacy in Wayne County is characterized by significant Revolutionary War service and the establishment of "Martins Mills," a center of local economic activity.

Veteran Profile: Nathaniel Martin

Nathaniel Martin (b. 1758) was a veteran who bore the scars of the Revolution, having been wounded at the Battle of Trenton. A particularly compelling detail of his service is his ten-year displacement; he was captured and eventually released in 1786. His arrival in Wayne County brought the prestige of a veteran to the burgeoning community of Indian Creek.

Economic Impact: Martins Mills

The family’s contribution was anchored by the operation of "Martins Mills." This facility was a primary economic engine for the neighborhood, which included the Cooper, Sims, and Davis families. The eventual transition of the mills to the Thompson family marked a shift in the local economy from Revolutionary land-grant holders to established industrial families, though the "Martins Mills" name endured as a landmark of the family's early influence.

7. Neighborhood Geography: The Social Fabric of Early Wayne County

In the settlement of Wayne County, no family functioned in isolation. The success of the Lawson, Brewer, Scott, Martin, and Pigg lines was bolstered by a dense "neighbor layer" of families with shared origins and political goals.

A Directory of Neighbors

* The Jacksons: Settlers like William Jackson were veterans who had fought with the "Swamp Foxes" of North Carolina. The strategic intermarriage between the Scotts and Jacksons—specifically Nancy Scott to Anderson Jackson and Mary Scott to Barnabas Jackson—effectively turned these two clans into a singular political and economic bloc.
* The Hortons: Isaac Horton, the father of Hannah Horton (wife of Rial Brewer), possessed a unique service record; he was a boatman responsible for transporting soldiers across the Hudson River during the Revolution.
* The Thompsons and Davises: These families were integral to the milling industry, often acting as successors or partners to the Martins in the 48 Mile Creek and Indian Creek sectors.

The Creek Communities

Geography dictated the social units of the county. The Indian Creek and 48 Mile Creek communities consisted primarily of families from North Carolina and Virginia. These creek valleys were distinct enclaves where families like the Cyperts, Scotts, and Faulkners constructed a collective history based on shared heritage and mutual frontier defense.

8. Conclusion: The Legacy of the Middle Tennessee Pioneers

The overarching migration of these families—from England and Ireland to the Virginia and Carolina colonies, through the Kentucky gap, and finally into the Middle Tennessee frontier—epitomizes the American pioneer spirit. Despite the catastrophic loss of courthouse records and the hardships of the "Old Mero" wilderness, the Lawson, Brewer, Scott, Martin, and Pigg families established a durable civic and economic foundation. Their story is preserved today through the "loose records" at the Tennessee State Library and Archives and the physical landmarks, like Granny Scott Hollow, that still bear their names.

Critical Takeaways for Descendants:

* Prioritize Archival Record Groups: Given the 1970s courthouse fire, researchers must move beyond county-level ledgers and utilize TSLA Record Group 483 (Bible Records) and State Supreme Court cases to verify heirs.
* Analyze Kinship Blocs: The "kinship economy" established through intermarriages (such as the Scott/Jackson and Scott/Pigg alliances) serves as a primary tool for tracking movement and identity when direct land deeds are missing.
* Ground Genealogy in Geography: Identifying specific creek community residence (e.g., 48 Mile Creek) is essential for distinguishing between individuals with common names and locating extant land grants and tax lists.
