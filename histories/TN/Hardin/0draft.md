The Founding of Hardin County, Tennessee: A Chronological History (1815-1840)

1.0 Introduction: A Land Before Settlement

1.1 The Untrodden Wilderness

Before 1815, the land that would become Hardin County existed as an untamed wilderness, a domain of dense canebrakes and abundant wildlife untouched by the footprint of the white man. This region served not as a place of permanent settlement for Native Americans, but as a rich and bountiful hunting ground. Tribes from Middle Tennessee would make treks into this area, following trails forged in search of fish and wild game, loading themselves with furs and meat before returning to their homes and farms near present-day Waynesboro.

According to the accounts of the first settlers, the landscape teemed with life. It was a veritable paradise for the hunter, offering an abundance of wildlife that included:

* Bear
* Wolf
* Beaver and other fur-bearing animals
* Wild turkeys
* Geese and ducks

This "paradise for the savage man" and habitation for wild animals was not destined to remain so. The inexorable march of history dictated that these hunting grounds would eventually be surrendered to "civilized men" to be cultivated and converted into fields of profit and settlement.

1.2 The First Claim: Colonel Joseph Hardin's Survey (1815)

The first official claim on this land was made in 1815 by Colonel Joseph Hardin. Traveling from Roane County, Tennessee, with a surveyor and chain-carriers, he selected and surveyed a two-thousand-acre tract on the east side of the Tennessee River, just south of the area now known as Cerro Gordo.

This claim was not a purchase but a reward. Col. Hardin had received a land warrant for his service as a colonel during the Revolutionary War, and he chose to lay that warrant in this fertile, unsettled territory. His intention, however, was not to settle the land himself. Rather, he selected it for his children, securing a future for his family in the new lands of West Tennessee. It is in his honor that the county was ultimately named Hardin County.

This initial survey by a war veteran marked the first step in a profound transformation, paving the way for the arrival of the first permanent settlers who would soon follow his path.

2.0 The First Settlers Arrive (1816)

2.1 The Two-Part Journey from Roane County

In the spring of 1816, a company of four families, numbering twenty-six people in total, began their journey from Roane County to the land surveyed by Colonel Hardin. To manage the transport of their household goods, livestock, and a full year's provisions, the company adopted a practical, two-pronged approach to the journey:

The Boat Company The Land Company
Members: Solomon Brazelton, Miss Sarah "Sally" Brazelton, and Joseph Gooden and his wife. Members: John Brazelton and his family, James Hardin and his family, Joseph Hardin, Jr., and his family, and Mrs. Elender Thacker and her family (twenty-two persons in all).
Travel: They set out on a small boat down the Tennessee River around June 7th. They hired a Native American pilot to navigate the treacherous Muscle Shoals. Travel: This group departed two weeks before the boat company, traveling overland with their horses and cattle.
Journey: The voyage lasted nearly three weeks on a river whose banks were a silent wilderness. They searched for a birch tree marked with Col. Joseph Hardin's name but missed it, eventually landing at the mouth of a large creek. Upon landing, Sarah Brazelton famously declared:<blockquote>I am going to be the first white woman to make a track in this wild country!</blockquote> Journey: Their progress was delayed for four weeks in Warren County while John Brazelton and James Hardin attended an Indian treaty. Afterward, they pushed through a roadless country, cutting their way through dense canebrakes along a creek until they made camp on July 15th.

2.2 A Colony United and the First House

On the evening of July 15, 1816, the land party heard the sound of a bugle down the creek. The next morning, they followed the sound and, about six miles away, found the boat company. The two groups were joyfully reunited on July 16, 1816, at a site known as Dr. Altum’s Spring.

There, the pioneers immediately set to work building the first house in Hardin County. It was a rude log cabin, just fifteen feet square, but it was a home. In honor of Colonel James Hardin, a leader of the expedition, they named the large creek where they had settled Hardin's Creek.

With the first home established, these families began the difficult and often perilous task of carving a life for themselves out of the raw frontier.

3.0 Life and Death on the Frontier (1816-1819)

3.1 The First Generation of Families

The initial settlement was composed of three core families, each with a distinct European heritage that contributed to the cultural makeup of the new colony.

* The Brazeltons (Welsh Descent): The family, led by patriarch John Brazelton, was the grandson of an immigrant from Wales. The family included his wife Hannah, sons Solomon, Benjamin, and William, and daughters Elender Thacker (a widow with two sons), Elizabeth, Sarah, and Nancy.
* The Hardins (Irish Descent): This family was led by Colonel James Hardin and his wife Nelly. They arrived with their nine children: sons Joseph, Benjamin, and James, and daughters Jane, Kizzie, Margaret, Mary, Elizabeth, and Elender.
* The Goodens (Irish Descent): The third family consisted of Joseph Gooden, his wife Hannah, and their two sons, James and Thomas.

3.2 Milestones of a New Colony

The early years of the settlement were marked by a series of "firsts"—events that defined the community's character and memorialized its struggles and triumphs.

1. The Colony's First Loss: The Death of John Brazelton (1816): On September 20, 1816, just two months after arriving, John Brazelton fell ill and died. His burial was a testament to the harsh realities of frontier life. His coffin was made of slabs split from a white-oak tree, his grave was dug with a mattock, and the dirt was moved with a wooden spade. In a poignant display of loyalty, his favorite dog followed the procession and was later found howling mournfully at the head of his master's grave.
2. First Separation and Cultivation (1817): Following Brazelton's death, the colony separated. James Hardin and Joseph Gooden settled on land near the Savannah and Clifton ford on Hardin's Creek, while the widowed Mrs. Brazelton settled near Indian Creek. That same year, James Hardin cleared the first ten acres of land in the county, marking the beginning of organized agriculture.
3. First Panther Killed (1818): While riding home one day, Miss Elizabeth Berry encountered two large panthers in a tree overhanging the path. She alerted her brother, Michael Berry, who returned with his gun and shot one of the animals dead. The small brook near where this occurred has been known as Panther's Branch ever since.
4. Frontier Justice: The Slaying of Blackwell (1819): A trapper named Blackwell stole a pony and furs from a Native American hunter. After a warning, Blackwell stole the pony again. The Indian followed him to his camp on Indian Creek, where a hastily assembled jury of white men decided in Blackwell's favor. The Indian, weeping at the injustice, then raised his gun and shot Blackwell dead. A company of men captured the Indian, who was taken to the Columbia jail but was eventually released. This event stands as the first homicide in the new settlement.

These foundational experiences—of life, death, and frontier justice—soon created an urgent need for the formal structures of governance that would transform a loose settlement into an organized county.

4.0 Forging a County: Governance and Growth (1820-1825)

4.1 The First Court and the Rule of Law (1820)

Four years after the first cabin was built, the pioneers of Hardin County met to establish a formal government. On January 3, 1820, a court was organized at the house of James Hardin. This "Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions" appointed the first public officials to uphold the rule of law.

Clerk Col. James Hardin
Sheriff Daniel Smith
Trustee Joseph McMahon
Register James Barnes
Ranger Henry Mahar
Coroner Stephen Roach
Chairman of the Court Isham Cherry

At its meeting in April, the court established the county's first tax levy to generate public funds. The rates were as follows:

* On each 100 acres of land: 18 ¾ cents
* On each town lot: 37 ½ cents
* On each free poll: 12 ½ cents*
* On each slave (ages 12-50): 25 cents
* On each retail store or peddler: $5.00
* On each tavern-keeper: $5.00

*Editor's note: The source text reads "free soil," which is likely a typographical error for the common term "free poll," or poll tax.

4.2 Building a Civil Society

Between 1820 and 1825, the framework of a civil society rapidly took shape, with the establishment of essential services in commerce, education, and transportation.

1. Early Commerce and Industry

* Milling: In 1820, Henry Garner built the county's first mill on Indian Creek. Before its construction, settlers had to make the long journey to a mill on Cathey’s Creek in Maury County.
* Craftsmanship: Jonathan Courtney, who arrived in 1817, was an indispensable craftsman. From his shop, he supplied settlers with plows, spinning-wheels (at $3 apiece), looms, and shoes (at 50 cents a pair).
* Retail: The first store was started in 1821 by Lewis H. Broyles, who brought $500 worth of goods down the river from East Tennessee and set up shop in a log house near James Hardin's.
* Agriculture: The first cotton-gins, essential for processing the region's future cash crop, were constructed in 1822.

2. Education and Religion

* First School: In 1824, the pioneers built the first schoolhouse near Indian Creek. It was a rustic, 18-foot-square log building with an earth floor, sleepers for seats, and no chimney—a fire was simply built in the center of the room.
* First Teacher: The first teacher was Thomas Stockton, who taught pupils using classic frontier textbooks: Pike's Arithmetic and Webster's old Spelling-book.
* First Church: A Baptist congregation built the first church in 1825. It was a simple 20x20 foot log structure, and its first preacher was Rev. Charles Kiddie.

3. Transportation

* Ferries: As the population grew on both sides of the Tennessee River, the court granted licenses for the first public ferries. These included ferries run by James F. McMahan (1821), Col. James Hardin (1821), and Thomas Shannon (1825).
* Ferriage Prices (1821): The court set official rates to ensure fair passage:
  * Wagon and team: $1.00
  * Man and horse: 25 cents
  * Single man or horse: 12 ½ cents
  * Each head of cattle: 6 ¼ cents
  * Each head of hogs or sheep: 3 cents

With these foundational elements of governance, commerce, and community in place, the county's population began to cluster into identifiable towns and civic centers.

5.0 The Rise of Towns and Civic Centers

5.1 Hardinsville: The First County Seat (1822-1829)

In July 1822, a committee officially located the geographic center of the county and purchased fifty acres of land to establish a county seat. This new town was named Hardinsville. The County Court, then in session at James Hardin's house, immediately adjourned to meet at the new capital.

For a brief period, Hardinsville flourished. A county jail was finished in 1825, Lewis Broyles relocated his store there from its original location, and John Kendal opened the county's first hotel in a log house.

5.2 Savannah: The New and Lasting Capital

It was soon discovered that Hardinsville, while geographically central, was too far east to conveniently serve the growing population settling on the fertile lands west of the river, prompting the search for a new, more accessible capital. In 1830, the seat of justice was moved to a location previously known as Rudd's Ferry. This new site was renamed Savannah, and it remains the county seat to this day.

The first courthouse in Savannah was a humble structure made of round gum logs. The town's early days were rustic and spirited, as captured in an anecdote about a fight between two noted brawlers, Gipson Hardin and Elisha Smith. So many spectators crowded onto the roofs of the town's simple "pole-cabins" to watch the fight that the structures collapsed, leaving Savannah "in ruins."

An influential early citizen of Savannah was David Robinson, who owned a large portion of the land where the town was built. He was a very active member of the County Court in his day, and it was through his influence that free ferriage was granted to justices living on the west side of the river.

5.3 Settlements on the West Side of the River

While the east side of the river was the site of the first colony, settlements quickly began to appear on the western side, which had long been a choice hunting ground for Native Americans.

The most significant early settlement was at the site that would become Saltillo.

* Thomas Shannon's Arrival (1822): Thomas Shannon made the first permanent settlement, arriving by keelboat from Davidson County with provisions and four enslaved men. His family followed by land with a herd of forty cattle. Shannon hoped to profit from raising cattle in the vast canebrakes, but the venture was a disaster; the cattle were not used to the cane, and thirty-nine of the forty died within three months.
* Hawkins's Landing (1825): In 1825, a merchant named Smith Hawkins brought $200 worth of dry goods to the landing and established the first store. The place became known as Hawkins's Landing. Early prices reflected the difficulty of transporting goods to the frontier:
  * Hats: $7.50
  * Shoes: $4.00 per pair
  * Coffee: 25-33 cents per pound
* Other Landings: As river traffic grew, several other key landings were established along the Tennessee River, including Coffee Landing, Crump's Landing, and the historically significant Pittsburg Landing.

The establishment of these towns and landings marked the end of the initial pioneer phase and the beginning of a period of sustained growth and development across the entire county.

6.0 Conclusion: Hardin County in 1840 - A Snapshot of Progress

In just twenty-five years, Hardin County transformed from an untrodden wilderness into a structured and growing society. A statistical review from the period of 1839-1840 reveals the remarkable progress made since the arrival of the first twenty-six settlers in 1816.

Here is a snapshot of Hardin County's development by 1840:

* Total Population (1840): The county was home to 8,240 people, consisting of 7,910 white residents and 330 slaves.
* Education (1839): The scholastic population (children aged 6-16) was 2,334. The total school fund available for public education was $1,454.43, which amounted to an apportionment of about sixty-two cents per scholar for the year.
* Land Use (1840): There were 77,087 acres of improved and occupied land in the county, with a total assessed value of $382,000.

This period of foundational growth laid the groundwork for the county's future. The incredible effort of its first pioneers had successfully achieved the goal set out from the beginning: the wild hunting grounds had been fully surrendered to civilization. As the county's first historian, B.G. Brazelton, summarized in 1885, "The once wild canebrake-lands on the east and the beautiful uplands on the west were fast changing into nice farms, and everywhere peace and prosperity seemed to reign supreme."
