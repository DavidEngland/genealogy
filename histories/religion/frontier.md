The religious landscape of these families evolved significantly across generations, shifting from the established traditions of the Virginia Tidewater to the radical movements of the frontier.
The established Church and Puritanism
Early generations in the Lewis and Ball lines were firmly rooted in the Church of England.
* John Lewis (the older son of John the Emigrant) served as a Vestryman of St. Peter’s Parish in New Kent County, a role that combined civic duty with religious stewardship.
* Susannah Lewis and Valentine Ball (1706–1770) were prominent members of Christ Church Parish in Middlesex County, where their marriage and the christenings of their children were formally recorded.
* The immigrant Richard Hargrave IV (1614–1686) was a Puritan whose beliefs were influenced by the Calvinist cloth towns of Yorkshire. His will reflects this Calvinist influence, written in "unflinchingly Puritan prose".
The Quaker Movement
A dramatic religious shift occurred in the Hargrave (later Hargrove) family during the late 17th century.
* Richard Hargrave Jr. (1645–1704) shocked his Puritan father by joining the Quakers, a group then considered a "pestilent sect" by the Virginia authorities. In 1682, he was brought to court for his "bizarre and outrageous Quaker fashion" of refusing to baptize his children.
* Samuel Hargrave Sr. (1712–1777) became a pillar of this faith, serving as the Clerk of the Cedar Creek Quaker Meeting for several years.
* Allied families were also integrated into this network; for example, John Cheadle (1671–1712) and his sons were identified as Quakers, and Nancy Thomas (wife of James B. Hartgrove) was a notable member of the movement, described as "vigorously anti-slavery and pro freedom of religious conscience".
Presbyterianism and the "Christian Soldier"
As families moved into the backcountry, Presbyterianism became a dominant force, often blending martial grit with piety.
* The Lewis and Whitley families embodied the "Christian soldier" archetype, a cultural model emphasizing discipline and divine duty in the face of frontier violence.
* During the 1777 siege of Logan’s Fort, women like Esther and Sarah Whitley maintained social order by teaching children the Presbyterian Catechism while under fire, using the familiar words as a form of "psychological anchoring".
* The Whitsett (Whiteside) family were also noted Presbyterians.
Frontier Baptism, Methodism, and "The Jerks"
By the time the families reached the Kentucky and Alabama Shoals, many descendants gravitated toward Baptist and Methodist faiths.
* John Washington Hargrove Sr. and his brothers diverged from their father's Quaker pacifism to serve as Minutemen during the Revolution, marking a break from the Friends' tenets.
* Rev. James Suggett and Rev. Jabez Ham were prominent Hard-Shell Baptist preachers in the early 19th-century settlements.
* The era was marked by the "Jerks," a religious phenomenon at camp-meetings where individuals under intense spiritual influence would experience violent, involuntary physical contortions. These meetings provided spiritual and social continuity for families like the Millers and Hams, with the first Methodist class in Callaway County organized in the cabin of Samuel and Polly Miller in 1819.
