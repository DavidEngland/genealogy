<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><b><br></b></span>

<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;">I have really just started this project. It is a long way from being finished. I'll be adding to it, little by little, day by day. It will be changing some in the future as well.</span></div>
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;"><b>WHO
WERE SEQUOYAH’S MOTHER’S PEOPLE?</b></span></span><br>
As with Sequoyah's father, some of the stories about his mother are contradictory. As with Sequoyah's father, the story all over the internet goes against what the Cherokee people and others have said. All over the internet, when people discuss her, she is called "Wurteh Watts". <br>
<br>
First, have a look at the syllabary (Tsalagi Gawonihisdi / <span lang="chr">ᏣᎳᎩ ᎦᏬᏂᎯᏍᏗ</span>) created by her son. Sequoyah's syllabary consists of 85 characters, each representing a syllable in the Cherokee language. All syllables end with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u, or v). The problem with her name being "Wur-teh" Watts becomes obvious. The syllable "Wur" is not in the Cherokee language—no Cherokee syllable ends with the "r" consonant sound. Some people call her "Wu-the" online. On the Cherokee Nation website she is called "Wu-te-he" (<span lang="chr">ᏭᏖᎯ</span>). "Tee-hee" (<span lang="chr">ᏘᎯ</span>) is a common Cherokee surname meaning "killer". I suspect the Cherokee themselves realized her name as recorded in earlier documents knew "Wur" made no sense as a Cherokee syllable, and they revised it to Wu-te-he.<br>
<br>
<b>The Cultural Significance of Sequoyah's Syllabary:</b> Sequoyah's creation of the Cherokee syllabary (ᏍᏏᏉᏯ Galiquogi) between 1809-1821 was a revolutionary achievement. Unlike most writing systems that took centuries to develop, Sequoyah created his syllabary in just over a decade. Within months of its adoption by the Cherokee Nation in 1825, thousands of Cherokee became literate. The syllabary enabled the Cherokee Phoenix (Tsalagi Tsulehisanvhi / ᏣᎳᎩ ᏧᎴᎯᏌᏅᎯ), the first Native American newspaper, to publish in both Cherokee and English starting in 1828. This writing system preserved the Cherokee language and culture,  allowing them to maintain their identity through written records, letters, religious texts, and legal documents. To this day, the syllabary remains a living symbol of Cherokee resilience and cultural pride.<br>
<br>
Second, nowhere is "John Watts Sr." listed as her father. Yet on the internet, you hear and see that all over the place. Somewhere someone wrote that John Watts Jr. became enrage when his Uncle "Old Tassel" was murdered. Someone else wrote that two of Wu-tee's uncles were Doublehead and Old Tassel. I have an Uncle Joe. His wife's nephews and nieces also had him as an Uncle, yet I am not related to them. My cousin Otho (called Sonny) also has the same Uncle, yet we do not descend from the same parents. Just because the two of them had the same uncle doesn't mean they are brother and sister. That leaves a chance for her to be related to John Watts Sr., but that's all. She might be related to John Watts Sr.'s wife, as well. One reference says Wu-teh's father's was part Shawnee and we know John Watt's Sr. was 100% Caucasian. Many people called her a full-blood. All the Cherokee who left records of her called her a full blood. John Watt's Jr, who was half-Cherokee spoke both English and Cherokee. In that case, why wouldn't his sister speak both English and Cherokee? She spoke no English.<br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">WHAT WAS THE NAME OF SEQUOYAH’S MOTHER?</span></b></span><br>
<b><br></b>
<br>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">After writing all that
information about Sequoyah’s father, a friend asked me about his mother, saying
to me; “I am interested in Sequoia's mother's line, and his wives' lines...” I
am pretty certain my family connects to Sequoyah on his father’s side, in some
manner. I think we are connected on his mother’s side too, but I am not as
certain of it. I thought I’d be more certain of it before researching that side
much further. There are a lot of contradictory stories about the identity of
Sequoyah’s father – but there are contradictions on Sequoyah’s mother’s
side of the family, too. I really didn’t want to get deeper into his father’s
side because it was so complicated and confusing. All the people who have
looked into it in the past have contradictory stories. But someone called me
out in public, as though they thought I was making claims I had never made. I
had to respond. I wasn’t being
called a liar this time – someone just wanted to know more about Sequoyah’s
mother. Her side is also going to be interesting to look into, as well.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">There are many resources. I’ll look into some aspect of her life, find what’s been
written, and report it. I always want to be objective, so most of the
conclusions I reach will probably be multiple choice probabilities. Well, here
goes.</span></span><br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;">
</span>
<br>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">I have chosen to call her
Wu-te-he (<span lang="chr">ᏭᏖᎯ</span>). When I spell it "Wu-teh" my computer thinks it is helping me by
changing it to "Wu-the" and I have to go back and change it back EVERY TIME!
After 20 or 30 times my computer thinking it knew better than me and making me
re-write it I can get a little edgy. A brainstorm – just change the spelling to
what is written on the website of the Cherokee Nation, Wu-te-he. The computer doesn't try
to change Wu-tee, either. Problem solved. In Sequoyah's syllabary, her name is written as <span lang="chr">ᏭᏖᎯ</span> (Wu-te-he), using three distinct syllables from the 85-character system he created.</span></span></div>
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">Much has been written
about his mother. On the Cherokee Nation's official website they say<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> "Her name was Wu-te-he (<span lang="chr">ᏭᏖᎯ</span>), and she belonged to
the Red Paint Clan (Ani-Wodi / <span lang="chr">ᎠᏂᏬᏗ</span>)". </i>(6) The Paint Clan was one of the seven traditional Cherokee clans (Anitsalagi / <span lang="chr">ᎠᏂᏣᎳᎩ</span>), responsible for making paint and dye from roots and plants for ceremonies, decorations, and face paint.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">I have read many things, but
not everything, about Sequoyah’s family. I have YET to read&nbsp; ANYTHING about how
we know his mother’s name was Wu-te-he. But I can know where to look this and
many other things up, pertaining to her, thanks to “The Mysteries of Sequoyah”
by Dub West. In one paragraph on page four he cites the sources for many of the
things that are said of Wu-te-he. Dub says;</span></span></div>

Tah-ya-ta-hee. <a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="_Hlk486146011"><span style="color: black;">Ethan Allen Hitchcock quotes a Mr. Payne

Cherokee woman. Traveler Bird indicates that she was a full blood. John B.
Davis states that she belonged to the Paint Clan and that her brother was a
Chief in Echota. This is substantiated by McKinney and Hall” </i>(1)</span></span><br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">So it is Jack Kilpatrick
who tells us that her family goes back to Moytoy (ᎼᏱᏙᎢ), and to Oconostota (ᎣᎪᎾᏍᏔᏘ). (11) Moytoy was recognized as "Emperor" of the Cherokee in 1730, and Oconostota was a great war chief who led the Cherokee during the Anglo-Cherokee War (1758-1761).</span></span></div>
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">It is Alice Marriott who
says her name was Wu-te-he of the Paint Clan (12), and that her brothers were
Tah-lo-te-skee (ᏔᏠᏖᏍᎩ) and Tah-ya-tee-hee. </span></span><br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">It was John B. Davis who said she had a
brother who was a chief in Echota (13), as did McKenney and Hall. (14) </span></span><br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">I am in
luck, as the Source for John B. Davis’ is the Chronicles of Oklahoma, and that
can be found online. The other sources might be harder to run down.</span></span></div>
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">Ethan Allen Hitchcock
quotes a Mr. Payne who lived near Sequoyah as saying that Sequoyah’s grandfather
on his mother’s side was Shawnee. (15) There were two Mr. Payne’s mentioned.
This one was part Cherokee and the other was a White man.</span></span><br>

James Mooney who said Wu-te-he descended from Mr. Watts, as he said she was "part White".. (16)</span></span></div>

full-blood Cherokee, she wasn’t a “Watts” then, was she? The Cherokee
themselves on their official website say; “Sequoyah's father was half Cherokee and his mother a full
blood.” (6) Yet I have seen genealogies online who say Sequoyah was only 1/4th Cherokee. People who personally knew his said if he had any White blood, it wasn't much -- he looked full blood.</span></span></div>

still living. It was published in the Cherokee Phoenix in both English and in
Sequoyah’s own syllabary.<span style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp; </span>He was still
alive at the time and he was a reader of every issue of the Cherokee Phoenix.

miles from Fort Smith and he was alive in 1837 when Stuart wrote this article.</span></span></div>

of either George Gist or Nathaniel Gist, indicating that he possibly had some
Caucasian blood, but very little -- that he appeared to be a full-blood. He
further says that it is a mistake to emphasize the father of a Cherokee family,
as the Cherokee society is matrilineal. Weaver says that Sequoyah appeared to
be a full-blood." </i>(1) So there were people who met Sequoyah who
thought Wu-te-he was full-blood, and so was even Sequoyah’s father!</span></span></div>

statement . . ." &nbsp;</i>It should be noted that she is also called a full
blood on the website of the Cherokee Nation. In Cherokee matrilineal society (Gadugi / ᎦᏚᎩ), tribal citizenship and clan membership pass exclusively through the mother's line, making Wu-te-he's heritage critically important to understanding Sequoyah's identity and place in Cherokee society.</span></span></div>

Wu-te-he was a mixed-blood Cherokee woman. I’m getting closer to the origin of
the rumor that Wu-te-he was a “Watts”. This legend is also on wiki-pedia where
I have found the following: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Watts_(Cherokee_chief)"><span style="color: #0563c1;">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Watts_(Cherokee_chief)</span></a>
: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“John Watts (or Kunokeski ), also known
as Young Tassel, was one of the leaders of the Chickamauga Cherokee (or
"Lower Cherokee") during the Cherokee-American wars. Watts became
particularly active in the fighting after the murder of his uncle, Old Tassel,
by militant frontiersmen who attacked a band of delegates traveling to a peace
conference in 1788. Watts was a "mixed-blood" son of a British trader
(who was also named John Watts, and was the official British government Indian
interpreter for the area — until his death in 1770). His mother was a sister of
Old Tassel, Doublehead, and Pumpkin Boy. Watts' parents resided in the Overhill
Towns along the Little Tennessee River. Wurte Watts, the mother of Sequoyah,
may have been a sister of John Watts."</i></span></span></div>

wiki-pedia it says it is likely Young Tassal (John Watts Jr) and Wu-te-he were
cousins. We see both trains of thought on wiki-pedia. If Wu-te-he was a “Watts”,
then John Watts was her brother. So many people say Sequoyah looked full blood,
and so many said Wu-te-he was full-blood. So I suspect John Watts Jr. was her
cousin rather than her brother.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

website says;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> “As far as his birth year,
the best estimation is from 1760 to 1765. Sequoyah stated that when an
Iroquoian Peace Delegation visited at New Echota in 1770, he was living with
his mother as a small boy and remembered the events. While in Washington in
1828, he told Samuel Knapp he was about 65.” </i>With due respect, I must humbly
say I disagree with the estimates (and there are several) which place
Sequoyah’s birth between 1760 and 1765 for at least four reasons:&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;">
</span>
<br>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">i.] Military documents
exist that state Sequoyah served in the military during the Creek Red Stick
Wars of 1813-1814. If he was born in 1760, he would have been 53 years old at
that time. Now the Creek Warriors they went up against would have been young
men, probably about 20 years old in the prime of their lives, who, like the
Cherokee, had trained to be warriors from a very young age. Young warriors
would have been eager to prove their manhood. But they would know an easy mark
when they saw it. All his life Sequoyah walked with a limp. Any smart young
Creek Red Stick Warrior would have gone after an old man with a limp in a heartbeat
– an easy coup.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">ii.] The second reason I
question these years as a possible time of Sequoyah’s birth would have been is
the last journey of his life. In 1843 Sequoyah, with a few friends, journeyed
from his home near Sallisaw up to visit John Ross for a few days, then they
took off for Mexico, south of the Rio Grande. He reached Mexico where he died
and is buried. This trip has been written down and is well documented by one of
his travelling companions, The Worm. If Sequoyah had been born in 1760 as some
suggest, he would have been 83 years old! It is difficult for me to see an 83
year old man making such a long journey sometimes on riding on the back of a
horse, and walking at times. There are several such accounts. I think
I will choose to look and see if there are other accounts that contradict this
one. Maybe they will seem more reasonable.</span></span></div>

us; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“. . . Sequoyah’s widow Sally, to
whom he married in 1815, and who, in 1855 at the age of 66 . . .” </i>So
Sequoyah’s wife Sally was born about 1789. This mean she was about 26 years old
when they married. This too makes me think Sequoyah was born closer to 1778
than 1760. He would have been 55 years of age when he married a 26 year old
girl. Sequoyah himself would have been closer to 37 years of age had he been
born in 1778. This makes me also suspect that Sally might not have been his
first wife. More on this later. One more contradiction, I recall reading an account that said he already had a wife and children by the year 1809 when he started on his syllabary. Was he married before Sally? Which stories do I believe, and which ones do I ignore?</span></span></div>

stated he remembered the Iroquoian delegation and others assumed he meant a
delegation that arrived in 1770 -- but the Iroquoia visited the Cherokee on many
other occasions that would have made Sequoyah a small boy well into the 1770s

project to get old Timers to tell what life was like in the Indian territory
before Oklahoma became a state. It is known as the Indian Pioneer Papers.
Sequoyah’s great granddaughter and her son (2) both participated. They tell us almost
nothing about his mother. They do say the following, however; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“Sequoyah was born soon after his father had
deserted his mother, and he grew to manhood among the Cherokees and as his
mother spoke only the Cherokee language, Sequoyah grew up without learning the

Sequoyah’s father deserted his mother before he was even born. This agrees with
the story Phillips wrote in “Harper’s Magazine” in 1870 and the story Foster
used for his book, “Sequoyah, American Cadmus” in 1885. Foster admits getting
his story from Phillips. Phillips was a Union officer during the Civil War in
Indian Territory. He says he got his story from the Cherokee, and some of the
descendants of Sequoyah. (3) (4). Both Phillips and Foster give Sequoyah’s
birth as about 1770.</span></span></div>

interviewed Sequoyah while he was in Washington D. C, and he said; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“Sequoyah is about 50 years old</i>.” (1)
This is the same trip another man has said he was about 65 years old. But if we
place Sequoyah’s birth as 1778 as Evarts suggests, it is a better fit for other
events of his life, for the four reasons mentioned above.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

was born, we can come to some estimation as to the age of his mother. IF
Sequoyah was born about 1778 as I suspect, and his mother’s child bearing age
was between 15 and 35, then we can think her probable date of birth would have
been 1743 and 1763. Let me just give an estimated date of birth of about 1750
to 1755. That would place her age between 23 and 28 at the time of Sequoyah’s
birth. So she was probably born just before the French and Indian War. This is
assuming Sequoyah was born in 1778. Now if Sequoyah was born closer to 1760 –
that would place her birth closer to the 1730s.</span></span></div>

<br><br><b>Note on Cherokee Clans:</b> In traditional Cherokee society (Tsalagihi Gadugi / ᏣᎳᎩᎯ ᎦᏚᎩ), clan membership passes from mother to child through the matrilineal system. Each clan had specific responsibilities and roles within the tribe. The Paint Clan (Ani-Wodi) was responsible for making sacred red and white paint used in ceremonies and face decoration.

Sequoyah have different clans! This means they have different mothers according to Cherokee gadugi (ᎦᏚᎩ / traditional law).&nbsp;
The only way we can have them being brothers is if they had the same father. In Cherokee culture, which is matrilineal (passing through the mother's line), clan identity is sacred and determines marriage eligibility, social responsibilities, and family connections. As
I have said before and will continue to say, there are many contradictions. Since Tahchee and Sequoyah had different clans, they had
different mothers. Wu-te-he wasn’t Tah-chee’s mother.</span></div>

adds; “Tessey Guess . . . was born in 1789.” If you read what was in other

This location is only about 8 miles from Echota (Chota / ᎠᎼᏯ ᎢᏤ), the capital of the old
Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayeli / ᏣᎳᎩᎯ ᎠᏰᎵ). Her name was Wu-te-he (ᏭᏖᎯ), and she belonged to the Red Paint Clan (Ani-Wodi / ᎠᏂᏬᏗ).
She had two brothers, Tahlonteeska (ᏔᏠᏖᏍᎧ) and Tahnoyanteehee". (6) Echota (also written as Chota) was the sacred peace town and capital of the Cherokee Nation before the forced removal on the Trail of Tears (Nunahi-Duna-Dlo-Hilu-I / ᏄᎾᎯ ᏚᎾᏙᎶᎯᎵᎩ, "The Trail Where They Cried").<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"></i></span></span></div>

GENEALOGY OF WU-TE-HE (ᏭᏖᎯ), MOTHER OF SEQUOYAH (ᏍᏏᏉᏯ)</span></b></div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">I have taken this long
journey hoping to discover the ancestors of Wu-te-he (ᏭᏖᎯ). What I have found is that
it will be very difficult to know her genealogy for certain. Personally, I
don’t think she was a “Watts”. I think she was a full-blood as many stories
about her say. But instead of a Watts, I am of the opinion that her father was full
blood Indian, and part Shawnee, as some have also said. I might be wrong on
both accounts. But there are just too many independent citations, too many
Cherokee who say Sequoyah got his Caucasian blood from his father’s side of the
family and that his mother was full blood Indian.<span style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp; </span>There are ACTUAL stories she goes back to
Moy-toy. There are people online who have created actual genealogies that show
her going back to him. I’d like to thank others who looked into this long
before me. I know they tried their best.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; margin: 0px;">But I know much genealogy
from the time of Wu-te-he backwards in time is largely a guessing game. If I
choose to believe one researcher who said she went back to “Oconostota and
Moytoy". I suspect her mother was the sister of Doublehead (Taltsuska / ᏔᎵᏧᏍᎦ) and Old Tassel (Kornatassel / ᎪᏁᏔᏎᎵ), and her
father was some unknown full blood Chickamauga warrior who was also part
Shawnee, the names of neither have been preserved to history. The Chickamauga Cherokee (Tsikamagi / ᏥᎧᎹᎩ) were a group who resisted colonial encroachment and separated from the main Cherokee towns.
<br><br>
<b>Conclusion - Legacy of Wu-te-he in Cherokee Culture:</b> Wu-te-he (ᏭᏖᎯ), though her own story remains partially obscured by time, gave the Cherokee people and the world one of its greatest gifts through her son Sequoyah (ᏍᏏᏉᏯ). As a member of the Paint Clan (Ani-Wodi / ᎠᏂᏬᏗ) and likely a full-blood Cherokee, she raised her son in the traditional Cherokee way, speaking only the Cherokee language (Tsalagi Gawonisdi / ᏣᎳᎩ ᎦᏬᏂᏍᏗ). Her dedication to preserving her language and culture in her home directly inspired Sequoyah's vision to create a writing system for his people. Today, when Cherokee people write their language in the syllabary, they honor not only Sequoyah but also Wu-te-he, who kept the language alive in her home and heart. Wado (ᏩᏙ / Thank you).</span></div>
