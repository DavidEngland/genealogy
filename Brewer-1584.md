== Biography ==

'''George Washington Brewer''' (c. 1750 – 1838) migrated from the Carolinas/Georgia frontier into Mississippi and Louisiana before settling in Hinds County, Mississippi, where he died in 1838. Recent '''Big Y-700''' results place him in the '''I-Y23708''' subclade (Howell Brewer line), not in the Lanier Brewer (I-Y29640) branch.

=== DNA and Parentage Update ===
* A living male descendant of George Washington Brewer tested '''Big Y-700''' at FTDNA and is in '''I-Y23708''', a branch of '''I-Y182422''' associated with the '''Howell Brewer''' line.
* This result makes it highly unlikely that George W. Brewer was a son of '''Lanier Brewer''' (I-Y29640). Current evidence points to him being a likely son of '''Howell Brewer Sr.''' (son of George Brewer and Sarah Lanier).
* Likely siblings in this Howell Brewer cluster (I-Y23708): Howell Jr. (father of Isaac, 1763–1852), John (father of Harmon), William (Rev War pension, Blount Co., TN), and now George Washington Brewer.
* Based on sibling birth ranges, '''birth is revised to about 1750''' (not 1760).

=== Migration Timeline ===
* Pre-1800: Georgia  
* 1810: Amite County, Mississippi  
* 1820: Washington Parish, Louisiana  
* 1830–1838: Hinds County, Mississippi (death and burial)

George was born about 1760. George Brewer passed away in 1838 in Hinds County, Mississippi.

GEORGE BREWER: moved to Georgia before November 21,1800.

By 1810 Records indicate they were in Amite County, Mississippi.

By census of 1820 they are in Washington Parrish, Louisiana.

In 1830 they are in Hinds County, Mississippi. Also listed on census page are families of Bickham, Bond, Millier, and Seale also know to live in Washington Parish and surrounding areas.<ref>"United States Census, 1830," database with images, FamilySearch [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHPZ-83P : accessed 28 November 2015], Geo Brewer, Hinds, Mississippi, United States; citing 210, NARA microfilm publication M19, (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.), roll 70; FHL microfilm 14,838.</ref>

Pg. 180 - Feb., 1798<br>
JOHN THOMPSON, Esqr. is appointed guardian of JEREMIAH THOMPSON, DORCAS THOMPSON, REBECCA THOMPSON, RUTH THOMPSON, GEORGE THOMPSON, ELIZABETH THOMPSON, & CHARLES THOMPSON, the heirs of BALAAM THOMPSON Esqr. , dec'd, to defend a certain suit brought against them by HANNAH THOMPSON, widow & relict of said BALAAM THOMPSON, for her dower in the lands of her said dec'd husband.<br>
(John represented the minor children as well as the other children who were of majority but, not named, in the law suit.) The court ordered a jury to survey the lands and lay out her widows dower and distribute the shares. <ref>ORPHAN'S INDENTURES & GUARDIANSHIP RECORDS IN COURT MINUTES Taken from Chatham Co. Court of Pleas & Quarter Sessions- 1774-1800 NC State Archives film #.022.30001[http://www.ncgenweb.us/chatham/orphan.htm]</ref>

1793 28 Dec, Volume 3, page 87, lists a deed of whereby George Brewer of Chatham County sold to Balsam Thompson of same for 60 pounds the same 79 acres of land that he had purchased in 1788 above. Witnesses were Lemuel Smith, Edmond Welch, and Richard Jones. George signed with "X". It was proven at the May Court of 1794 by Lemuel Smith.

1800 On 21 Nov 1800 was a deed involving a Hannah Brewer, who was a daughter of the man referenced in the next deed below:<br>
Volume 3, page 94, lists a Chatham County deed of 26 Dec 1800, wherein Nathan Brewer of Chatham County sold the two small tracts of land that had formerly belonged to Balaam Thompson, deceased. One of the tracts was 34 acres lying on both sides of Tick Creek, beginning in Terrell Brooks line. The other tract was 42 acres, beginning at the original line. Details are listed under John Brewer, Sr. (G9) below. Nathan Brewer also granted all of the rights that he and Johanan Ricks (written as Bicks in 1799 above) might have in the "thirds" of the land then held by the widow Hannah Thompson.
Witnesses were Lemuel Smith, William Dixon, and Henry Henson.
Nathan appears to have signed his name. In the previously-mentioned deed of 21 Nov 1800, Jeremiah Thompson, attorney for his sister Hannah Brewer of Georgia, and Ruth Thompson of Chatham County, NC sold to this same buyer Benjamin Bagley for $50 three tracts of 30 acres each in the pine woods. The lands belonged to Hannah and Ruth as legatees and children of Balaam Thompson, Esq. deceased. Under a previous division, Hannah's land was designated as lots No. 8 & 9, and Ruth's was lot No. 7, all joining each other on the waters of Tick Creek and on the main road leading to Tyson's Ferry on the Deep River. It is not clear to whom Hannah Brewer was married. Nathan appears to have lived in North Carolina after Hannah had moved to Georgia, so she was apparently not his wife. Perhaps she was the wife of one of his brothers.<ref>Location: [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/BREWER/2012-09/1347209154]

== Research Notes ==
* '''Parentage:''' DNA places him in I-Y23708 (Howell Brewer line); not a son of Lanier Brewer (I-Y29640). Probable son of '''Howell Brewer Sr.''' (son of George Brewer & Sarah Lanier).  
* '''Birth:''' Adjusted to c.1750 to align with sibling cohort in the Howell Brewer cluster.  
* '''DNA Contacts:''' Terry White (Brewer DNA Project; kit matches in I-Y23708).  
* Continue to monitor Brewer DNA Project publications for the formal placement of this test.
