== Biography ==

'''Philemon Gresham''' (1800–1850) was a prominent **plantation owner and businessman** whose land and legacy were foundational to the development of the **Mars Hill community** in Florence, Alabama.

=== Early Life and Ancestry ===

Philemon was born on **April 12, 1800**, in **Wilkes County, Georgia**. He was the fourth child of [[Gresham-187|Thomas Gresham]] (age 38 at Philemon's birth), the first legal white settler of Lauderdale County, and [[Thornton-1459|Mary Thornton]] (age 27 at Philemon's birth). He was part of the early pioneer migration that moved from Georgia into middle Tennessee and eventually into the **Doublehead Reserve** area of Alabama.

=== Marriage and Family ===

He married **Delilah Files** in Lauderdale County on **January 19, 1823**. Delilah (1805–1877) was the daughter of **James Files** and **Sarah Holcomb**. Together, they raised a large family of at least **5 sons and 9 daughters**:

* **Sara Adeline Gresham Anderson** (1824–1904)

=== Plantation and Business Affairs ===

Philemon was a successful planter whose **Mars Hill plantation** became a regional landmark. He built the original **Gresham family home around 1828**; the structure was known for its durability and is still standing today as part of the Mars Hill property. As a businessman, he maintained active accounts with local industries, such as the **Mars Hill Iron Works** operated by Johnson and Wright, where he commissioned work for farm equipment and even family coffins.<ref>Mars Hill property records; Johnson and Wright business ledgers</ref>

His daughter [[Gresham-293|Julia Esther Gresham Larimore]] inherited **twenty-seven acres** from his estate, which she and her husband T. B. Larimore used to establish Mars Hill Academy in 1871.<ref>Mars Hill Academy records; Larimore family history</ref>

=== Siblings and Family Connections ===

Philemon was one of several children of [[Gresham-187|Thomas Gresham]] and [[Thornton-1459|Mary Thornton]]:

* [[Gresham-188|Elizabeth Gresham]] (ca. 1805 – after 1860), who married Joseph Manson Rice. Their son **Thomas Gresham Rice** became Professor of Pure Mathematics at La Grange College.<ref>Rice family records; La Grange College archives</ref>
* **John Richardson Gresham** (1794-1849)
* **George Gresham** (1796-1850)
* **Thomas Gresham** (1798-1885)

* **Catherine Gresham Willis** (1814-1857)

=== Historical Conflict Regarding Death ===

There is a documented **chronological conflict** regarding the exact date of Philemon's death. The *Florence Gazette* of August 17, 1850, reported: "Died Tuesday evening, 13th instant, Philemon Gresham, an old and respected citizen of this county."<ref>Florence Gazette, Aug 17, 1850</ref> However, he is also listed as **Head of Household in the 1850 Federal Census**, which was conducted on **October 25, 1850**.<ref>1850 United States Federal Census, Lauderdale County, Alabama</ref>

**Resolution:** Modern genealogical consensus, supported by the Florence Gazette obituary, probate records, and family tradition, confirms his death as **August 13, 1850**. The 1850 census enumeration, conducted two months after his death, likely recorded his household based on information from his widow Delilah. Alabama probate records for "Philamena Gresham" (a variant spelling) align with an 1850 death date.<ref>Alabama, U.S., Wills and Probate Records, 1753-1999; Gresham Cemetery tombstone records</ref>

=== Death and Legacy ===

Philemon Gresham died on **August 13, 1850**, in Lauderdale County, Alabama, at the age of 50. He was buried in the **Gresham Cemetery at Mars Hill**, located on his former plantation. His daughter, [[Gresham-293|Julia Esther]], inherited twenty-seven acres of his estate, which she and her husband, the renowned minister **T. B. Larimore**, used to establish the **Mars Hill Academy** in 1871. The Philemon Gresham home was restored in 1971 and currently serves as a museum dedicated to the history of the school and the Larimore family.<ref>Mars Hill Museum records; Larimore family history</ref>
