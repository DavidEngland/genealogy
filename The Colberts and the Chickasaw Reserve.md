# The Colberts and the Chickasaw Reserve

While Chief **Doublehead** (ᏔᎵᏧᏍᎦ) controlled the Cherokee reserve stretching from **Cypress Creek to the Elk River** on the eastern side of the Shoals, the western territories belonged to the **Chickasaw Nation**, where the influential **Colbert family** held sway as mixed-blood intermediaries between indigenous and white cultures.

## The Colbert Dynasty

The **Colbert brothers**—**George, Levi, James, William, and Pittman**—were the sons of **James Logan Colbert**, a Scottish trader, and **Chickasaw women** of high standing within the tribe. This mixed heritage positioned them as natural brokers between two worlds during the critical period of land cessions and white encroachment in the early 19th century.

### Strategic Position and Power

The Colberts operated along the **Natchez Trace** and controlled key river crossings and ferries across the Tennessee River:

* **George Colbert's Ferry:** Located near present-day Cherokee, Alabama, this became the most important crossing point for settlers moving into the Tennessee Valley
* **Levi Colbert (Itawamba Mingo):** Served as the principal chief of the Chickasaw Nation and was the primary negotiator in land treaties with the United States
* **James Colbert:** Operated ferry services and trading posts that connected the frontier economy

### The Chickasaw Land Cessions

Unlike the Cherokee reserve under Doublehead, which was rapidly overrun by illegal squatters, the Chickasaw territories were managed through a more deliberate series of negotiated cessions:

* **1805 Treaty:** The Chickasaws ceded lands in Middle Tennessee but retained control of their traditional hunting grounds south of the Tennessee River
* **1816 Treaty:** Following the War of 1812, the Chickasaws ceded their lands **north of the Tennessee River**, opening what would become Lauderdale County to legal white settlement
* **The Colbert Role:** The Colbert brothers negotiated these treaties, often receiving private reserves and annuities as compensation for their influence

## The Border Between Two Reserves

The western boundary of **Doublehead's Cherokee Reserve** (Cypress Creek to Elk River) directly adjoined the eastern edge of **Chickasaw territory**, creating a complex political landscape:

* **Fort Hampton (1810):** Built at the mouth of the Elk River to police the boundary between Cherokee and Chickasaw lands and to evict illegal white squatters
* **Military Patrols:** Federal troops under **Colonel Return Meigs** enforced treaty boundaries, often burning the cabins of intruders who had settled in both the Cherokee and Chickasaw reserves
* **Competing Land Claims:** White settlers who were evicted from Doublehead's reserve often attempted to cross into Chickasaw territory, creating ongoing tensions

## The Colbert Economic System

The Colbert family established a sophisticated economic network that paralleled the development seen in white frontier communities:

### Commercial Operations

* **Ferries and River Crossings:** The Colberts operated the primary ferry system across the Tennessee River, charging fees that made them wealthy
* **Trading Posts:** They maintained stores that supplied both Native Americans and white travelers along the Natchez Trace
* **Plantation Agriculture:** Some Colbert family members operated cotton plantations using enslaved African American labor, mirroring the economic model of white planters

### Cultural Intermediaries

The mixed-blood status of the Colberts allowed them to navigate both worlds:

* **Language and Literacy:** Educated in both English and Chickasaw, they served as translators and negotiators
* **Dress and Custom:** They adopted European-style clothing and housing while maintaining Chickasaw political structures
* **Legal Representation:** They represented Chickasaw interests in treaties and land negotiations with the United States government

## Connection to Your Ancestors

Your ancestors in the **Gresham, McDonald, and Whitten** families would have been directly impacted by the Colbert-controlled Chickasaw territories:

### The 1816 Opening

* **Thomas Gresham:** When he returned to claim his land along **Blue Water Creek** in 1816, the legal opening of Lauderdale County was made possible by the Chickasaw cession negotiated by **Levi Colbert**
* **River Crossings:** Early settlers moving from Tennessee into Alabama would have used **George Colbert's Ferry** as the primary crossing point
* **Trade Networks:** The **McDonald gunsmiths** and **Lewis brickmasons** likely conducted business with the Colbert trading posts before the final removal of the Chickasaws in the 1830s

### The 1830s Removal

Following the **Indian Removal Act of 1830**, the Colbert family was among the last to leave:

* **Treaty of Pontotoc Creek (1832):** The Chickasaws agreed to move west of the Mississippi River
* **Colbert Migration:** The Colbert brothers led their people along the **Trail of Tears** to the Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in 1837-1838
* **Waterloo as Departure Point:** Like the Cherokees, many Chickasaws were processed through **Waterloo, Alabama**, the river port that served as a staging area for removal

## Legacy in the Shoals

The removal of the Colberts and the Chickasaw Nation completed the transformation of the Shoals from a contested borderland into the settled agricultural region where your ancestors established their permanent farms and workshops:

* **Land Availability:** The 1832 cession opened millions of acres for white settlement
* **Infrastructure Development:** The ferry sites and trading posts established by the Colberts became the foundations for new towns
* **Economic Transition:** The artisan economy of the **McDonald gunworks** and the **Gresham-Whitten farming communities** replaced the mixed-blood trading networks of the Colberts

## Historical Irony

The Colbert family's role as intermediaries ultimately facilitated their own displacement. By negotiating land cessions and operating as cultural brokers, they made possible the very system of white settlement that would lead to the **Trail of Tears** and the end of Chickasaw presence in the Shoals region.
