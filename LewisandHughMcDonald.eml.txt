Hi David, I have a Hugh McDonalds from SC who fought at Charleston 1776 & later went to Casey Co KY. I am also interested in the brick layer, Joseph Francis Lewis, who built William Whitley house. I think he may have bricked Joseph Bledsoe's house at Creelsboro, KY. Stay in touch, Larry Witt Somerset, KY
