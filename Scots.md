== The Scottish Heritage of Clan Donald ==

We cam frae a race o' **warrior herdsmen**, ye ken, famous above all for our fighting prowess. Every McDonald o' our line is descended frae the blood o' **Somerled o' the Isles** and his grandson **Donald**, the first chief o' the clan. In the old tongue, we were the **Domhnaills**, and it's an ancient maxim that there is no joy in this world without Clan Donald.

=== The Highland Experience ===

The glens o' Scotland were bonnie but the history was heavy. We dinna forget the treachery at **Glencoe** in 1692, when the Campbells took shelter in our homes and then fell upon our people while they slept—a horror each generation is bound to tell the next.

After the **Battle o' Culloden** in 1746, when the Highland cause was broken, many o' our kin sailed across the great sea to the Colonies to find a new life. Among them were the **McDonalds** and their kinfolk, carrying their traditions and determination to a new world.

=== The Duncan Connection ===

Then there's the **Duncans**, a braw lot frae **Aberdeen**. **John Duncan the Elder** cam to Pennsylvania about 1740 before settling on the creek that bears his name in South Carolina. He was a hardy pioneer, the most remote settler in his district for many a mile.

His son **James** was a true warrior who followed the hunt for seven long years, roaming frae the rivers deep into the mountains. Your ancestor **Moses Duncan** dwelt in the **Laurens District** until the great wagon trains led our families through the wilderness toward the **Cypress Creek** country.

=== The Whitley Pioneer Line ===

Ye mustna forget **Solomon Whitley**, who left Ireland to escape religious persecution and established **Whitley's Station** in the Kentucky wilds. His son, **William Chapman Whitley**, was a legendary Indian fighter who built **"Sportsman's Hill,"** the very first brick house west o' the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Solomon's daughter **Sarah** married the brickmason **Joseph Francis Lewis**, who likely used his skilled hands to lay the bricks for that grand historic home. This marriage united two frontier families whose craftsmanship and courage shaped the early American settlement.

=== The McDonald Settlement in Alabama ===

By the time **John McDonald** and **Margaret Emory** left the Carolinas, they settled briefly at Wartrace, Tennessee, before reaching **Lauderdale County** in 1834. John's son, **Thomas Anderson McDonald**, followed the family trade as a blacksmith and **gunsmith**. He and his brothers made **"Kentucky Rifles"** near Green Hill that were accurate and beautiful "works o' art"—a skill passed down through generations.

Our folk were always "music lovers," passionately fond o' **jigs, reels, and fast fiddling**, even when the "straight-laced" neighbors in the Shoals thought them a bit worldly. This love o' music and celebration reflected the resilient Highland spirit that endured despite frontier hardships.

=== Palina Altimira: A Bridge Between Worlds ===

And then there was **Palina Altimira**, born at the springs o' Tennessee in 1859. Because her name was a muckle bit complicated for the neighbors to say, she was known only as **"Kitty."** Even the census-takers struggled with our Scots heritage, often writing the name as **"McDaniel"** because they couldna hear the name right.

Kitty married **William England**, a hunter and farmer, and lived as a **vital bridge** in our story, carrying the resolve and independence o' the Highlands into the heart o' Alabama. Through her children and grandchildren, the McDonald legacy continued to shape the communities of North Alabama and Tennessee.

=== Legacy ===

From **Somerled o' the Isles** to the frontier settlements of Alabama, our family carried forward the warrior spirit, the craftsman's skill, and the Highland love o' kinship and celebration. Though our tartan and our Gaelic tongue were left behind in the old country, the heart o' Clan Donald beat strong in every generation that followed.
