== Biography ==

'''Serena Welch''' (WikiTree ID: [[Welch-1878]]) was born approximately '''1833''' in '''Tennessee'''. She was the daughter of '''Elijah C. Welch''' (1810–1867) and '''Mary Taylor''' (1801–1880).

=== Marriage and Family ===

Serena married '''[[Hargrove-287|James Monroe Hargrove]]''' (1818–1884), whose family was part of the prominent "western aristocracy" that settled the Kentucky and Tennessee frontiers. Through this marriage, Serena was connected to the noted '''Whitley and Lewis families'''; her father-in-law was the War of 1812 veteran '''[[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]]''', and her husband's grandmother was '''[[Whitley-753|Sarah Whitley]]''', sister of the legendary Indian fighter '''Col. [[Whitley-757|William Whitley]]'''.

Serena and James established their household in '''Hardin County, Tennessee''', where James Monroe Hargrove is enumerated in the 1850 census alongside his father, Valentine.

=== Children ===

Serena and James were the parents of at least seven documented children, all born in Tennessee:

* '''[[Hargrove-361|Lydia Serena Hargrove]]''' (1854–1897): Married James Ervin White.
* '''Mary Wright Hargrove''' (b. 1856): Married a Mr. Godwin.
* '''Minerva Jane Hargrove''' (b. 1859)
* '''Martha Hargrove''' (b. 1862)
* '''Margaret Alice Hargrove''' (b. 1864)
* '''James Alexander (Columbus) Hargrove''' (b. 1866)
* '''Lorenzo Dow Hargrove''' (b. 1868)

=== Death and Legacy ===

Serena Welch Hargrove passed away in '''1884''', the same year as her husband. She left a legacy of resilience within a network of pioneer families—including the '''Hargroves, Whites, and Whittens'''—who were foundational to the religious and social development of the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands.
