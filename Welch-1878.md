=== Life in Hardin County ===

By 1860 and 1870, Serena is enumerated in the household of her husband James Monroe Hargrove in Hardin County.<ref>"United States Census, 1860," database with images, ''FamilySearch'' (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M8TD-MLN : accessed 26 Jul 2017), James M Hargroves, Hardin County, Tennessee; citing NARA microfilm publication M653.</ref><ref>"United States Census, 1870," database with images, ''FamilySearch'' (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MDD7-3B6 : accessed 12 Apr 2016), James Hargroves, Hardin County, Tennessee; citing p. 18, family 116, NARA microfilm publication M593.</ref>

Her household was centered along the Tennessee–Alabama border, with ties to the Whitley-Lewis frontier families through her husband's parents, [[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]] (1778–1858) and [[Lewis-15890|Ruth Whitley Lewis]] (1783–1858). The family resided near the Crossroads community, where Valentine lived with them in his later years.

=== Family Heritage ===

Through her marriage, Serena connected two significant lineages:

* The '''Welch family''' — descended from Loyalist Major [[Welch-185|Nicholas Welch]], who fought for the British at the Battle of Ramsour's Mill during the American Revolution
* The '''Hargrove family''' — descended from Patriot [[Hargrove-261|John Washington Hargrove Sr.]], who fought for American independence

This union symbolized the reconciliation of former enemy families on the Tennessee frontier, where veterans from both sides of the Revolution settled together after the War of 1812.

=== Death ===

Serena Welch Hargrove died in 1884 in Hardin County, Tennessee. Her husband James Monroe died the same year.
