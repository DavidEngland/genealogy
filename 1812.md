Valentine’s kin served extensively in the **War of 1812**, holding positions ranging from high-ranking officers to volunteer privates in both the **Kentucky and Illinois militias**.

### **Service in the Illinois Militia**
The Illinois units were primarily tasked with **defending the frontier home ground** against indigenous raids.
*   **Major Willis Hargrave:** A prominent leader in the Illinois Territory, he was appointed Captain of the **3rd Regiment of Illinois Militia** in 1810 and promoted to **Major of the 4th Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers** by 1814.
*   **The Sons of Willis Hargrave:** His sons **Samuel and Seth Hargrave** served as Lieutenants under their father’s command, while their brother **George B. Hargrave** served as a Captain in the same regiment in 1814.
*   **Colonel William Hargrove:** He commanded the **Ranger service** in the southwestern part of the state and was a veteran of the **Battle of Tippecanoe**.

### **Service in the Kentucky Militia**
Unlike the Illinois units, the Kentucky militia often served alongside **Federal troops** in major offensive battles.
*   **William Whitley (Valentine's uncle-in-law):** Though he was over sixty years old, the famed pioneer enlisted as a private in **John Davidson’s company** of the **Kentucky Mounted Infantry**. He was killed at the **Battle of the Thames** on October 5, 1813, while leading the **"Forlorn Hope,"** a suicide mission of twenty volunteers who rode out to draw the fire of Tecumseh’s warriors.
*   **John Robert Hargrave (Valentine's brother):** A veteran of the Revolution, he served as a private alongside Whitley in **Ewing’s Company** of the **1st Regiment of Kentucky Mounted Riflemen**.
*   **Joseph Francis Lewis (Valentine's father-in-law):** He served as a **Private in the 7th Regiment, Kentucky Militia**, demonstrating his commitment to the frontier defense while in his late 50s or early 60s.
*   **James E. Hargrave:** The son of Hezekiah and Susannah Hargrave, he served as a private in the same **Kentucky Mounted Rifleman** unit as his uncle John Robert.

These relatives were part of a broader military effort to secure the **Northwestern frontier** and participate in the **Thames Campaign**, which effectively ended the British-Indian alliance in the region.
