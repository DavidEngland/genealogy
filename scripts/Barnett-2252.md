== Biography ==

**Elizabeth Barnett** was born in **Northern Ireland** about **1723**. She married **Solomon Whitley** (Whitely) in **Ireland before 1745**, and the couple emigrated to America to escape **religious persecution**.

=== Settlement and Migration ===
Elizabeth and Solomon first settled in **Augusta County, Virginia** (in the portion later incorporated into **Rockbridge County**), where most of their children were born. Around **1782**, they joined their children on the Kentucky frontier and ultimately died at **Whitley’s Station** (also known as **Walnut Flat** or **Walnut Creek**) in **Lincoln County, Kentucky**.

=== Family and Legacy ===
Elizabeth and Solomon raised a large family that became foundational to early frontier settlement. Some sources list **nine children**, while other accounts suggest a few individuals traditionally listed as their children may have been Solomon’s brothers. Documented children include:
* **William Chapman Whitley (b. 1749)**, legendary Kentucky frontiersman.
* **Margaret Whitley (abt. 1747–1831)**, married **George Clark** and traveled to Kentucky with William.
* **Sarah Whitley (abt. 1752–1837)**, married brickmason **Joseph Francis Lewis**.
* **Ruth (Whitley) Collier (abt. 1748–1789)**, married **Moses Collier**; her descendants include Union General **John Aaron Rawlins**.
* **Other children:** Mary, James (a Baptist minister), Solomon Jr., Catherine, and Thomas.

Elizabeth was the mother-in-law of **Esther (Whitley)**, wife of William Chapman Whitley.

=== Domestic Life ===
The household was rooted in the **Presbyterian faith**. Solomon was known for teaching their children and grandchildren the **old Presbyterian Catechism** before his death. Elizabeth likely died **around 1782–1783**, shortly after her husband. Solomon is sometimes described as a minister, theologian, or member of the clergy; this needs a source.{{Citation needed}}
