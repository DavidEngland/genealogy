The migration of **Valentine Hargrove** and his wife **Ruth Whitley Lewis** illustrates a classic Southern frontier pattern, moving from the revolutionary atmosphere of Virginia and Kentucky into the emerging **Mississippi Territory** during the War of 1812 era.

### **Tracking the Migration through Children's Births**
The birthplaces of their children provide a clear roadmap of the family's westward and southward movement:
*   **Kentucky Beginnings:** Following their marriage on October 9, 1799, in **Lincoln County, Kentucky**, the family initially settled in the **Pulaski County** area. Their eldest children, including **Elizabeth Louisiana** (b. 1804) and **Samuel Ball** (b. 1806), were born in Pulaski.
*   **Arrival in the Mississippi Territory (Alabama):** The sources confirm the family arrived in what was then the **Mississippi Territory** by the mid-1810s. **William Wesley** was born in **Alabama** in 1816. By 1818, the family was established in **Madison County**, where **James Monroe** (b. 1818), **Omar Hassen** (b. 1820), and **John Lindsey** (b. 1826) were born.
*   **The War of 1812 Context:** During this period, Madison County was a strategic hub within the Mississippi Territory. While the sources do not explicitly name Valentine's specific unit in the Alabama region, they document extensive service by his close kin: **Colonel William Hargrove** commanded the Ranger service and fought at **Tippecanoe**, and **Willis Hargrave** served as a Major in the **Illinois Militia**. Additionally, Valentine's brother-in-law **William Whitley** and brother **John Robert** served in the **Kentucky Mounted Riflemen**.
*   **Final Settlement in Hardin County, Tennessee:** By 1830, the family had moved across the state line into **Hardin County, Tennessee**, where their youngest son, **Jackson**, was born. Valentine spent his final years there, residing in the household of his son, **James Monroe Hargrove**, until his death between 1851 and 1860.

### **The Narrative of the "Good Warrior"**
The Hargrove family was characterized by the rugged independence of the **Scots-Celtic** frontier. One of the most defining family stories involves Valentine traveling with his uncle-in-law, the famed **Colonel William Whitley**, on a peace mission to **Cherokee towns** to retrieve white prisoners. When the party was confronted by warriors who painted themselves for battle and shook horse bells to signal their intent to kill, Whitley asked Valentine if he could fight. Valentine reportedly declared he would **"fight till he died,"** showing such resolution that the Indians complimented him as a **"good warrior"** and allowed the party to return safely with a rescued child.

### **Ancestral Legacy in The Shoals**
This lineage remains central to your history because it directly connects to the **England and Whitten** families. Valentine's son, **James Monroe Hargrove** (1818–1884), remained in the borderlands, and his daughter **Lydia Serena Hargrove** married **James Ervin White**. Their daughter, **Myrtle White**, married **Early Whitten**, eventually becoming the grandmother of your mother, **Bessie Whitten England**. These families were part of the "western aristocracy" that transitioned the region from a contested native reserve into the settled agricultural heart of **Lauderdale County**.
