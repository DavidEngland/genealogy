== Biography ==

The name '''Valentine Ball''' appears across three centuries of colonial and frontier history, representing a multi-generational legacy defined by land acquisition, military service, and strategic family alliances.

=== The Early Patriarchs ===

The lineage began with '''Valentine Ball (1616–1670)''', the son of Richard Ball, who migrated from London to the '''Henrico settlement''' in Virginia. His marriage to '''Susannah Lewis''' (born c. 1620) initiated a persistent genealogical link between the two families that endured for over 200 years.

The most prominent patriarch was his descendant, '''Valentine Ball (1706–1770)''' (WikiTree ID: [[Ball-532]]), who was born on '''31 March 1706''' in '''Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County, Virginia, USA'''. He was the son of '''[[Ball-537|Henry Ball]]''' and '''[[Brooks-3974|Alice Mary (Brooks) Ball]]'''.<ref name="marriage"/>

Valentine was a hardworking landowner known for his precision in the delicate process of "rolling" and storing '''tobacco leaves'''. Records from 1753 indicate he was involved in the tobacco trade, specifically being paid for '''"rolling and storing tobacco"''' from Westham to the Falls. He owned substantial property, at one time mortgaging '''540 acres''' of his homestead to Glasgow merchants.

In the 1760s, he transitioned from a Tidewater planter to a '''colonial frontiersman''', moving his family to the rugged '''Amherst County''' wilderness. By 1770, he was a man of significant influence, witnessing land deeds alongside notable officers like '''Captain James Dillard'''. Upon his death in March 1770, his will provided for his wife and ten children, famously leaving '''one shilling sterling''' to most of his offspring—including '''[[Ball-555|Mary Ball]]''', who married '''[[Hargrove-261|John Washington Hargrove Sr.]]'''—to legally protect the will from being contested.

=== Marriage ===

When Valentine was 26 he married '''[[Lewis-1457|Susannah Lewis]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Lewis-1457]]) (1717–1792) on '''31 January 1733''' in '''Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County, Virginia'''.<ref name="marriage">

This union was a pivotal consolidation of family interests, linking the Ball line to the influential Lewis network.

=== Research Notes ===

'''Washington Connection:''' While family tradition often claims kinship to the Ball family of '''George Washington's mother''' (Mary Ball Washington of Lancaster County), genealogical research by Donna Rachal Mills [Lennon] in ''Some Southern Balls, from Valentine to Ferdinand and Beyond'' (1993) explicitly states there is '''no evidence''' to support a connection between Valentine Ball of Amherst County and the Balls of Lancaster County, Virginia.

'''Land Records:''' Valentine Ball maintained properties in multiple Virginia counties:
* Henrico County deeds (1750s)
* Amherst County deeds (1760s)
* Mortgaged 540 acres to Glasgow merchants (documented in estate records)

'''Occupational Records:''' 
* 1753: Payment records for "rolling and storing tobacco" from Westham to the Falls
* Multiple land transactions indicating substantial wealth
* Voter registration records (1752) confirming landowner status

=== The "Valentine" Heritage ===

The recurrence of the name served as a '''cultural inheritance''' and a '''living pedigree'''. It signaled a multi-generational commitment to the '''"Christian soldier" archetype'''—a blend of martial prowess and religious devotion highly valued on the dangerous frontier.

==== The Revolutionary Soldier ====

The next generation produced '''Valentine Ball (c. 1755–1841)''', likely a grandson or nephew of the elder Valentine of Amherst. Residing in Chesterfield County, he served extensively in the '''Virginia militia''' during the American Revolution. His service included:
* Guarding military stores at '''Portsmouth''' under Colonel Meredith.
* Garrisoning '''Williamsburg''' under General Charles Scott.
* Serving in a '''"flying corps" of dragoons''' to deter British incursions along the James and Appomattox rivers.

==== Legacy in the Hargrove Line ====

This heritage was carried forward into the Hargrove family through '''[[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]]''' (1778–1858), the son of Mary Ball. Named to honor his maternal grandfather, he extended the family's reach into '''Kentucky and Tennessee''', where he earned the reputation of a '''"good warrior"''' during rescue missions into Cherokee territory. Ultimately, the "Valentine" name became a signature of stability and integrity as the family established permanent industrial settlements, such as '''gristmills and sawmills''', along the '''Alabama Shoals'''.
