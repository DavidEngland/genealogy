== Biography ==

'''Julia Esther Gresham Larimore''' (1845–1907) was the first wife of prominent Church of Christ minister '''Theophilus Brown Larimore''' and a foundational figure in the establishment of the '''Mars Hill''' community in Lauderdale County, Alabama.

=== Early Life and Ancestry ===

Born on '''July 11, 1845''', in Lauderdale County, she was the daughter of '''[[Gresham-190|Philemon Gresham]]''' and '''[[Files-34|Delilah Files]]'''. Her father was a successful plantation owner and businessman whose family home, built around 1828, became a central landmark in the '''Mars Hill''' area. Esther was raised in a family deeply rooted in the Shoals' pioneer history, living on the plantation land that would eventually become the campus for the Larimores' educational and spiritual endeavors.<ref>Family oral history; Gresham plantation records</ref>

She was '''born again''' (converted to Christ) on '''October 21, 1859''' at age 14.<ref>Tombstone inscription, Gresham Cemetery</ref>

=== Marriage and the Founding of Mars Hill ===

Esther married '''T. B. Larimore''' on '''August 30, 1868'''.<ref>Marriage records; Larimore family history</ref> In '''1870''', the couple utilized '''twenty-seven acres of land''' that Esther had inherited to build their spacious 12-room home. They selected a site framed with virgin oak, elm, and hickory, insisting on heavy sills to "successfully resist time, as well as tornadoes".<ref>Larimore family history; Mars Hill property records</ref>

This home became the heart of '''Mars Hill Academy''' (later Mars Hill Bible School), which opened on '''January 1, 1871'''. While T. B. Larimore was often away for months at a time conducting protracted meetings across the United States, Esther remained a constant presence at the school, which operated for seventeen years under their leadership and drew students from across the South.<ref>Mars Hill Academy records; Larimore correspondence</ref>

=== Religious Life and Musical Legacy ===

As a member of the '''Church of Christ''', Esther's life was defined by the early Restoration Movement's commitment to scriptural worship.

* '''A Cappella Tradition:''' Within this tradition, the use of musical instruments in worship was not allowed, as the gospel was believed to be something that should be sung with the voice alone.<ref>Church of Christ worship tradition, c. 1864</ref>
* '''Choir Leadership:''' Family history notes that Esther served as the '''choir director for over 30 years'''. This aligns with the historical context of the era, where professional "songsters" taught singing schools to provide congregational music that was considered "uplifting and enlivening" during the region's intense religious revivals.<ref>Family oral history; Church of Christ congregational records</ref>

Her tombstone honors her as "a sweet singer" and notes she was "always consecrated, loyal and true to Christ and his cause."<ref>Tombstone inscription, Gresham Cemetery</ref>

=== Family ===

Julia Esther and T. B. Larimore had six children:

* '''Mary Delilah "Dedie" Larimore George''' (1869–1959)
* '''Dr. Granville Lipscomb Larimore''' (1871–1925)
* '''Dr. Theophilus Brown "Toppie" Larimore Jr.''' (1872–1903)
* '''William Herschell Larimore''' (1874–1928)
* '''Julia Esther "Ettie" Larimore White''' (1876–1960)
* '''Andrew Virgil Larimore''' (1879–1972)

Her tombstone describes her as "a dutiful daughter, an affectionate sister, a faithful friend, a loyal helpful hopeful wife, a model mother."<ref>Tombstone inscription, Gresham Cemetery</ref>

=== Death and Burial ===

Julia Esther Gresham Larimore passed away on '''March 4, 1907''', after 38 years of marriage. She was laid to rest in the '''Gresham Cemetery''' at Mars Hill, located directly across from the Larimore Mansion. Her husband eventually moved to California, but the Mars Hill home was restored in 1971 and now serves as a museum dedicated to their shared legacy.<ref>Find A Grave memorial 27517648; Mars Hill Museum records</ref>
