A prominent **Magistrate** in Wayne County, John Martin had previously been married to **Anna Elizabeth** (Carrell or Snapp). Together, John Martin and Cynthia had at least eight sons and four daughters and established a substantial family presence in the Western Highland Rim region.

She lived in **Wayne, Tennessee**, United States for about ten years and later in **District 10, Grainger, Tennessee**, United States in **1870**. During her widowhood following John Martin's death around 1870, Mary Cynthia was recorded in census records.
