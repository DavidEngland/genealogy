=== Civil War Service ===

George Washington Lawson served in the '''Union Army''' during the American Civil War, enlisting on 21 September 1862 at Bethel, Tennessee.<ref name="military">Compiled Service Records, 6th Tennessee Cavalry (Union), Company F, M392 Roll 8.</ref> He was mustered into service in November 1862 with the rank of '''Sergeant''' in '''Company F, 6th Regiment Tennessee Cavalry (Union)''' under Captain David I. Dickerson. He was later reduced in rank to '''Private'''.

His service reflected the strong pro-Union sentiment of Wayne County, Tennessee, which voted to remain in the Union during the 1861 secession referendum by a margin of 905 to 409. This Union loyalty was shared by his father-in-law, Rial Brewer, who served in the '''10th Regiment Infantry (1st Middle Tennessee Infantry)''' and died during the war on 13 November 1862 in Louisville, Kentucky.

==== Regimental History ====

The 6th Tennessee Cavalry (Union) was organized at Bethel, McNairy County, beginning in August 1862. Company F was organized at Bethel and mustered into service at Bolivar and Grand Junction, Tennessee, in November 1862. The regiment was mustered out at Pulaski, Tennessee, on 26 July 1865.

The regiment participated in numerous engagements throughout West Tennessee, including:
* December 1862 – Defense of Jackson during General Nathan B. Forrest's first raid into West Tennessee
* January 1863 – Skirmishes at Trenton, Humboldt, and Clifton as Forrest recrossed the Tennessee River
* May 1863 – Action at Linden against the 27th Tennessee Infantry (CSA)
* July 1863 – Fighting around Forked Creek and Jackson against Confederate forces under Biffle, J.A. Forrest, Cox, and Newsom
* October 1863 – Engagements at Holly Springs, Salem, Byhalia, and Wyatt, Mississippi

The regiment lost a total of 396 men during service: 2 officers and 33 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, and 9 officers and 352 enlisted men died of disease.

George Washington Lawson served honorably throughout the war and was discharged as a '''Private''' on 26 July 1865 at Pulaski, Tennessee.

==== Pension ====

After the war, George received a Union Army pension for his service.<ref name="pension">"United States, Veterans Administration Pension Payment Cards, 1907-1933", FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QJDQ-9LV8 : accessed 31 Oct 2025), Entry for George W Lawson, from 1907 to 1933.</ref>

==== Pension Testimony ====

George W. Lawson provided affidavit testimony on 13 May 1897 in support of the pension application of his fellow Company F soldier, John E. Horton. At that time, George was 56 years old and residing at Lutts, Wayne County, Tennessee. He testified alongside John M. Lawson (age 54), confirming their service together in the 6th Tennessee Cavalry.<ref name="horton_pension">Pension file for John E. Horton, Co. F, 6th Tennessee Cavalry (Union), pension numbers 470.327 (1883) and 965.564 (1901).</ref>

==== Family Tradition ====

Family oral history states that George and Sarah went to Oklahoma hoping to “get rich,” and that George died there but was returned to Tennessee for burial at Cromwell Crossroads Cemetery.<ref name="oral_history">Oral history from David England’s grandmother (undated), recorded in family conversation prior to her death.</ref> The same tradition notes that a daughter who married a Bridgers remained in Oklahoma. It also says George was disabled following Civil War service, and that his service card and a photograph show the effects of that disability; this is a family recollection and needs documentary confirmation.<ref name="oral_history" />
