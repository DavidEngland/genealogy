== Research Notes ==
The following summary is adapted from research notes attributed to Gary Wayne Brewer (contributed via AshleyButler8). These notes represent hypotheses and inferences that require documentary confirmation before being treated as facts.

* '''Parentage hypothesis''': Henry is suspected to be a son of [[Brewer-708|Lanier Brewer Jr.]], but no proof has been found. A Henry Brewer in the 1810 Moore County, North Carolina census is cited as a possible match for Henry’s household.
* '''Marriage''': Henry is reported to have married Mary Cockman (born about 1781). Two of Mary’s sisters, Margaret and Sarah Cockman, are reported to have married Brewer brothers Solomon and Julius; this needs documentation.
* '''Tennessee records''': Henry appears in Lawrence County court records (jury service on 4 May 1818; additional entries through 7 Jan 1822). He is listed in the 1820 census and a special 1819 county census, reportedly living in the Shoal Creek area alongside Wiley Brewer (believed to be a brother).
* '''Wayne County residence''': Henry is reported in Wayne County by the 1830 census and appears there through at least 1850.
* '''Estate analysis (1855–1856)''': Henry died without a will. Estate settlement records (administered by Henry Jefferson Brewer) are reported to divide the estate into nine parts, implying nine children or heirs. Several identifications are inferred from distributions to named heirs and guardianships:
	* A.J. Brewer, H.J. Brewer, Thomas Cash, A.J. Risner, and William Martin (with wives Nancy, Elizabeth, and Sarah named in census records).
	* Shares to Lewis A. Brewer and to W.L. Hardwick and J.P. Bromley (married to Nancy and Martha J., daughters of George W. Brewer). This is cited as evidence that George W. Brewer was Henry’s son.
	* A share to administrators of Enoch Brewer’s estate is interpreted as evidence Enoch was Henry’s son.
	* Another share divided among multiple Hensley heirs suggests a daughter who married a Hensley and died before Henry.
	* A final share divided among G.W. Brewer, J.N. Brewer, and G.W. Ray is interpreted as another child’s family.
* '''Uncertain links''': Several connections (e.g., Rachel/Milly May; William Brewer; Joseph Brewer as a minor heir) are suggested but not proven in the notes. These need record-based validation.
* Draft prepared for manager review.
* Need citations for birth, marriage, death, and residence(s).
