Re: George Washington Brewer (Brewer-1584)

Hi! I’m Terry White, a long time member of the Brewer DNA Project at FTDNA. Although my surname is ‘White’, genetically, I belong to the same Brewer family shown here. My particular subclade is I-Y23708, a branch of the larger clade known as I-Y182422, believed to represent living male descendants of George Brewer of Brunswick County Virginia (husband of Sarah Lanier), who died in 1744. (More about my own Brewer connection below …)

You and your fellow administrators of this profile (Brewer-1584) will probably find the news I have to share to be relevant and quite interesting. I have it on good authority from one of the administrators of the Brewer DNA Project today, that the as yet unpublished results of a new Big Y 700 test have just now come in, and they’re of a living male descendant of this particular George Washington Brewer (lineage below). Those results place him (and this George, Brewer-1584), squarely and decidedly into the same I-Y23708 subclade which I’m also part of.

What this means is that this George Washington Brewer is highly unlikely to have been a son of the Lanier Brewer shown here, because he (Lanier) belongs to a different branch of I-Y182422, identified by the subclade SNP I-Y29640.

Instead, rather, these new DNA test results indicate pretty reliably that this George Washington Brewer (Brewer-1584) is almost certainly part of the ‘Howell Brewer’ subclade I also belong to, identified by the SNP known as I-Y23708. Thus, there now appear to be at least four likely sons of Howell Brewer Sr (son of George and Sarah Lanier Brewer):
1) Howell Jr (father of Isaac,1763-1852),
2) John (father of Harmon Brewer),
3) William (1832 Rev War pension application, Blount County TN), and now
4) this George Washington Brewer.

Moreover, given the known or suspected range of birth years for his DNA-indicated siblings, we now believe that the birth year of this George Washington Brewer was more likely closer to 1750 than 1760.

Here’s an abbreviated lineage of the living male descendant whose DNA test is under discussion here:

George Washington Brewer (c.1750-1838)
Balaam Brewer (c.1790-1865)
Caswell Cummings Brewer (c.1828-1918)
Castro Juan Brewer (1848-1910)
Castro Charles Collier Brewer (1888-1954)
Clayton Castro Brewer (1923-1996)
Living Male Brewer (DNA test)

My own particular direct ancestor, based on my own and the DNA test results of several of my closest matches (both Brewers and Whites), and also based on my own careful and exhaustive analysis of the genetic evidence (informally “peer reviewed” and approved by the lead administrator of the Brewer DNA Project, Hank Graham, a retired scientist), is as follows:

Howell Brewer Jr (c.1740-post 1807)
Jacob “Jake” White (c.1772-c.1861)
William Wilson White (1800-1895)
Francis Marion White (1827-1925)
William Cornelius Green White (1858-1942)
Francis Marion White (1886-1950)
Homer Spence White (1915-1943)
James Francis White (1937-2020)
myself (FTDNA kit number 177950)

I myself am also at YFull.com, and on Gedmatch (M142005), and I will be happy to provide further information about this living male descendant of this George Washington Brewer (Brewer-1584) as soon as the information becomes public.

You’re welcome to email me at &#116;&#106;&#119;&#104;&#105;&#116;&#101;&#49;&#57;&#54;&#51;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;, if you wish. I’m well known to the administrators of the Brewer DNA Project. I used to be one of the admins myself, back when my job allowed me more time.

If you wish to examine my analysis of the genetic evidence which establishes my own conclusions about my Brewer ancestry, you may find it at the Wikitree page for George Brewer Sr (husband of Sarah Lanier). Or, I can send it separately upon request.

Sincerely,
Terry White
