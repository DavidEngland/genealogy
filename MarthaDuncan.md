Based on the sources provided, there is no mention of a **Sarah Clark** marrying **Moses Duncan**. However, the sources do provide information on a **Sarah Whitmore** in connection with your ancestor **Moses Duncan**.

### **Moses Duncan and Sarah Whitmore**
According to the sources, **Moses Duncan** (who died in **1845** in **Jasper County**) was married to **Sarah Whitmore**. They were residents of the **Newberry District in South Carolina** before the family’s migration. This union produced your 3rd-great-grandmother:
*   **Martha E. Duncan:** Born on **July 25, 1832**, in **Lauderdale County, Alabama**, she was the daughter of **Moses Duncan**.
*   **Marriage to Whitten:** Martha married **Jesse P. Whitten** (1827–1882) on **June 14, 1850**, in **Lauderdale County, Alabama**. This union carried the **Duncan** name into the Whitten and eventually the England and White lines.

### **The Duncan Line Context**
While the specific name "Sarah Clark" is not found in the Duncan records, the lineage of Moses Duncan is well-documented as part of the **Aberdeen, Scotland** branch:
*   **Ancestry:** Moses was a descendant of **John Duncan "The Elder"** (born c. 1720 in Aberdeen), who was the first remote settler on **Duncan’s Creek** in South Carolina.
*   **The Family Spirit:** The Duncans are described as part of a race of **"warrior herdsmen"** from the Highlands, known for their **"fighting spirit, independence, and resolve"**.

### **Other Sarah Clarks in Your Ancestry**
Though not married to Moses Duncan, the names **"Sarah"** and **"Clark"** appear elsewhere in your family records, which may be the source of the confusion:
*   **Mary Clarke:** She was the wife of **Sir Edward Gresham** of Titsey and the mother of the immigrants **John** and **Edward Gresham** (born 1613).
*   **Sarah Harvey/Fernes:** She was the first wife of your ancestor **James Clark** (1610–c. 1689), an early settler of **New Haven, Connecticut**.
*   **Sarah Whitley Lewis:** The daughter of **Solomon Whitley**, she married the brickmason **Joseph Francis Lewis** in **1779**.
*   **Lydia Scott:** A **Lydia** (likely daughter of Capt. John Hotchkiss) married a **Stephen Clark** in **1716**.

**Summary for your records:**
The sources provided identify the wife of **Moses Duncan** from the Newberry District of South Carolina as **Sarah Whitmore**. If you have external family information indicating her maiden name was **Clark**, it is not reflected in these specific historical documents, which consistently use the name **Whitmore** for the matriarch of that branch.
