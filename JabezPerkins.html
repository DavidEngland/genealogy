      <p>Introduction</p>
</center>

<p>This page is devoted to Jabez Perkins and his ancestry. I find Jabez an interesting ancestor. Born in New Haven, CT,
      before the American Revolution, he was raised in a Loyalist household in the North Carolina back country. As a
      child he saw his Father, Timothy, and paternal Uncle, Joseph, join the Loyalist forces against the Americans.
      According to contemporary accounts, his Father and Uncle were, "notorious Tories" who one time captured Col.
      Cleveland, an American commander and virtual warlord in the New River settlements. While being held for trial by
      the Loyalists, Cleveland was able to escape, supposedly with the help of one of the women of the household. The
      family were early Methodists.

</p>
<p>By 1784 a guardian was appointed for Jabez in Wilkes Co., NC. Normally, one would assume this to mean that his father
      was dead. However, Dow Perkins wrote that Timothy Perkins was alive and living in Grayson Co., VA. This writer
      knows of no documentation to support that statement. Shortly after the guardian was appointed, Jabez appears to
      have married and moved to Montgomery/Grayson Co., VA, where several of his children were born. In 1789, he was
      appointed administrator to the estate of his maternal Uncle, William Sperry, in Wilkes Co., NC. It is not yet
      known if William Sperry was a Loyalist or if he supported the Americans in the Revolution. In the February 1807
      term of the Ashe County Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions, the case of Jabez Perkins vs. Elisha Blevins was
      heard. The verdict is unreadable. (see, http://www.ls.net/~newriver/nc/as1807co.htm ).

</p>
<p>By 1813 he was in the Knox/Whitley Co. KY, area. Sometime after 1830, already 65 years old, he moved his family to
      the Bureau/Putnam Co. Illinois area. He and his sons purchased land in 1835 and 1836. By December of 1835 he had
      returned to Whitley Co., KY, where he made his will and died before February 13, 1836. Jabez' son William returned
      to Whitley Co. and remained there the rest of his life. The rest of Jabez' children remained in Illinois or moved
      further West.

</p>
<p>Some researchers have identified Jabez' wife as Nancy Ann Creekmore. I am not convinced that this is correct. I am
      also not convinced that his wife at the time he made his will is the mother of his children. Hopefully, further
      research in NC or VA will turn up a marriage certificate to settle the question.

      <p>Notes on Sources</p>
</center>

<p>I first began family research at age 11 when my Mother died. At the time, three of my Grandparents were alive. Had I
      known to ask them, many of my present dead lines might have been solved. Instead, like many young children, I put
      the research away and returned to it in college. I seriously started working on it in 1979 when I was studying for
      the bar exam. By then I had gotten to the family of Timothy Perkins and knew of Jacobus' sketch of the Perkins
      Family of New Haven, but I did not have evidence of the connection between my Timothy and the one from New Haven.
      I got the lead for that link at a birthday party for my maternal Uncle, Arnold Ball. There I was directed to
      relatives on both sides of my family who had done genealogical research.

</p>
<p>I contacted Orville and Gloria Manning Perkins who referred me to Judge Paul M. Perkins and to Donald Perkins. Donald
      Perkins had commissioned work which found the will of Abel Sperry which mentions the marriage of Timothy Perkins
      with Mariam Sperry and their removal to North Carolina. With that and the work of Paul M. Perkins, I started to
      fill out the rest of the tree. I have done so by searching for contemporary records about the persons discovered
      in my research. At this time, I am concentrating on the following records: military records; wills and
      administrations; church records; marriage records; and population census records. Further research will extend to
      land records; court records and the farm and manufacturing censuses. I have cited secondary records where they
      appear to be based on primary record sources.

<center><b> FIRST GENERATION
      </b></center>



<p><b>1. Jabez<sup>1</sup> Perkins (Timothy, 2). Born, 6 Nov 1766, in New Haven,
            New Haven Co., CT. Died, circa 1836, in Whitley Co., KY. Occupation: farmer.
      </b>
</p>
<pre>      In 1784, George Morris was appointed Guardian to Gebas Perkins (Wilkes
Co., NC, Will Bk 1, p.123). In 1789, Jabish Perkins was administrator of
William Sperry, dec'd. (Wilkes Co., NC, Will Bk 1, p. 254). Inventory of the
Estate of William Sperry is in Wilkes Co., NC Will Bk 1, p. 262 dated 1789. In
1784, Wm. Smith was the Administrator of W. Sperry (Wilkes Co., NC Will Bk 1,
p. 122).

      Between 1784 and 1813, Jabez was in Grayson Co. VA, before removing to
Knox Co., KY.

      Jabez Perkins received Knox Co. Circuit Court Certificate No. 160 for 200
acres of land on 5 Oct. 1813. This is now called Tellico Grant No. 575. It was
surveyed on 24 August 1821 and was in the new county of Whitley on the Gelico
River. He paid off his mortgage for the full price of $20.00 to the
Commonwealth of Kentucky on 22 January 1828. See, Tellico Grants, No. 575, Book
2, page 1, Land Office, Kentucky Secretary of State.

      Sometime after 1830 Jabez and his family moved to the Bureau/Putnam Co., area
of Illinois. Jabez purchased 80 acres of land in Bureau Co., on 13 July 1835
(IL Pub. Dom. Land Tract Sales, Arch. vol. 708, p. 119).  Jesse and William also
purchased 80 acres of land on the same day in the same township as Jabez. Timothy
had purchased two 80 acre tracts in the same township on 20 and 25 June 1835. Jesse
purchased additional tracts of 40, 160 and 80 acres on 7 Sept 1835, and 14 Jan
1836.

      Jabez' son Solomon Perkins may have been the Solomon Perkins who purchased
land in Adams Co., IL, on 27 June 1818.  This was a Military land bounty (IL Pub.
Dom. Land Tract Sales, Arch. vol. 808, p. 481).

was a son of William Perkins, Merchant-Taylor of London. Edward died, circa 1688,
 in New Haven, New Haven Col, CT (Between 25 January 1687, date of deeds to sons,
and recordation date of 19 March 1690). Immigration: 1637, in New Haven, New Haven
Colony, CT. Occupation: planter-farmer.</b>

      He took the Oath of Fidelity 18 October 1648. New Haven Colony records
show the following land transactions: 7 Nov 1654, he received 5 acres from
Richard Hubball (v.1, p.226); 3 July 1655, he received the house and lott of
Thomas Barnes, which was Stephen Metcalfes (v.1, p. 245); 7 Jan 1667/8, he
receives land from Nathaniel Richards and Rosamond, his wife, of Norwalke (v.2,
213).

      The estate of Edward Perkins was appraised at L306 in the 1680 division
of land in the City of New Haven, with Edward receiving 77 acres in the
division.

      He made the following deeds to his sons on 25 January 1687/88: Edward
Perkins of New Haven, Planter, "to loving son John Perkins" grant of mansion
house wherein I lately dwelt with its home lot and one half the barn; 8 acres
of arable land in the Suburbs Quarter; 1.5 acres of land in the Suburbs
Quarter; 8 acres in the Yorkshire Quarter; 2 acres in the Neck in Mr
Lambertson's Quarter; 1/2 of 8 acre meadow at the bottom of Yorkshire Quarter
to divide with Jonathan Perkins; 44 acres of the 2nd Division; 26 acres of the
3rd Division; and, 1/2 right and title in the Ox Pasture and all other
undivided lands. New Haven, CT, Register of Deeds, vol. 1, p. 489).

      Edward Perkins of New Haven, Planter "to loving son Jonathan Perkins"
grant of mansion house where I now dwell together with said son; home lot and
1/2 barn; 3 acres in the Suburbs Quarter; 9 acres in the Suburbs Quarter; 4
acres in the Yorkshire Quarter; 5 acres in the Neck; 1/2 of 8 acres in the
lower end of Yorkshire Quarter to be divided with John Perkins; 44 acres 2nd
Division; 25 acres 3rd Division; and, 1/2 of Edward Perkins interest in Ox
Pasture and all other undivided lands. (New Haven, CT, Register of Deeds, vol.
1, p. 488).

Haven, cordwainer" grant 4.5 acres in the Suburbs Quarter; 2 acres in the
Yorkshire Quarter; 1 acre of meadow in the Yorkshire Quarter; 1 acre in the
Neck; 12 Acres of 2nd Division; and, 25 acres in the 3rd Division. (New Haven,
CT, Register of Deeds, vol. 1, p. 490).

      All three of these deeds were recorded on 19 November 1690. It is
presumed that Edward died between 25 January 1687/88 and 19 November 1690.
There are only two other deeds from Edward Perkins recorded in the extant New
Haven Register of Deeds. These are to John Perkins, vol. 1, p. 82, and to
Joseph Moss, vol. 1, p. 273. In none of the deeds is a wife mentioned. It is
therefore presumed that she was dead before 1672.

      There is no reference to his estate in either the New Haven Probate
Packets or the New Haven Probate Records.

      He married Elizabeth Butcher (33), 20 Mar 1648/9, in New Haven, New Haven
Co., CT (By Mr Goodyear, New Haven VR, 1:46). Children:

  16       i.  John<sup>5</sup>.
          ii.  Mehitabel. Born, 21 Sep 1652, in New Haven, CT. Died, before
               1688?, in New Haven, CT.
                     It is assumed that Mehitable died young or before marriage
               age since there are no recorded land transactions from Edward
               Perkins to "my son in law" or "in portion of my daughter". He
               did transfer his property to his sons in 1688.
         iii.  Jonathan. Born, 12 Nov 1653, in New Haven, CT. He married Mary

               Sarah Bradley, 19 Jun 1729, in New Haven, CT.
                     On 4 December 1732, administration of his estate was
               granted to Dan'll Perkins on sufficient bond ( New Haven Probate
               Records, volume 6, page 84). An inventory was presented in
               January 1733/4 (New Haven Probate Records, volume 6, page 124).
               Daniel Perkins presented a further account of administration and
               an agreement between the heirs of David Perkins for recording on
               8 January 1733/34. The agreement was accepted as a settlement of
               the estate. It is difficult to read and is not reproduced in
               full. It was signed by the following: William Punchard?;
               Mehitable Punchard, by mark; Dan'll Perkins; Caleb Thomas; David
               Gilbert; and, Experience Gilbert, by mark (New Haven Probate
               Records, volume 6, pages 125-126).
