</p><center><p>Introduction</p></center>

<p>This page is devoted to Jabez Perkins and his ancestry. I find Jabez an interesting ancestor.  Born in New Haven, CT, before the American Revolution, he was raised in a Loyalist household in the North Carolina back country.  As a child he saw his Father, Timothy, and paternal Uncle, Joseph, join the Loyalist forces against the Americans.  According to contemporary accounts, his Father and Uncle were, "notorious Tories" who one time captured Col. Cleveland, an American commander and virtual warlord in the New River settlements. While being held for trial by the Loyalists, Cleveland was able to escape, supposedly with the help of one of the women of the household. The family were early Methodists.

</p><p>By 1784 a guardian was appointed for Jabez in Wilkes Co., NC. Normally, one would assume this to mean that his father was dead.  However, Dow Perkins wrote that Timothy Perkins was alive and living in Grayson Co., VA.  This writer knows of no documentation to support that statement.  Shortly after the guardian was appointed, Jabez appears to have married and moved to Montgomery/Grayson Co., VA, where several of his children were born.  In 1789, he was appointed administrator to the estate of his maternal Uncle, William Sperry, in Wilkes Co., NC.  It is not yet known if William Sperry was a Loyalist or if he supported the Americans in the Revolution.  In the February 1807 term of the Ashe County Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions, the case of Jabez Perkins vs. Elisha Blevins was heard. The verdict is unreadable. (see, http://www.ls.net/~newriver/nc/as1807co.htm ).

</p><p>By 1813 he was in the Knox/Whitley Co. KY, area.  Sometime after 1830, already 65 years old, he moved his family to the Bureau/Putnam Co. Illinois area. He and his sons purchased land in 1835 and 1836.  By December of 1835 he had returned to Whitley Co., KY, where he made his will and died before February 13, 1836.  Jabez' son William returned to Whitley Co. and remained there the rest of his life. The rest of Jabez' children remained in Illinois or moved further West.

</p><p>Some researchers have identified Jabez' wife as Nancy Ann Creekmore. I am not convinced that this is correct.  I am also not convinced that his wife at the time he made his will is the mother of his children.  Hopefully, further research in NC or VA will turn up a marriage certificate to settle the question.

</p><center><p>Notes on Sources</p></center>

<p>I first began family research at age 11 when my Mother died.  At the time, three of my Grandparents were alive.  Had I known to ask them, many of my present dead lines might have been solved.  Instead, like many young children, I put the research away and returned to it in college.  I seriously started working on it in 1979 when I was studying for the bar exam.  By then I had gotten to the family of Timothy Perkins and knew of Jacobus' sketch of the Perkins Family of New Haven, but I did not have evidence of the connection between my Timothy and the one from New Haven. I got the lead for that link at a birthday party for my maternal Uncle, Arnold Ball.  There I was directed to relatives on both sides of my family who had done genealogical research.

</p><p>I contacted Orville and Gloria Manning Perkins who referred me to Judge Paul M. Perkins and to Donald Perkins.  Donald Perkins had commissioned work which found the will of Abel Sperry which mentions the marriage of Timothy Perkins with Mariam Sperry and their removal to North Carolina.  With that and the work of Paul M. Perkins, I started to fill out the rest of the tree.  I have done so by searching for contemporary records about the persons discovered in my research.  At this time, I am concentrating on the following records: military records; wills and administrations; church records; marriage records; and population census records.  Further research will extend to land records; court records and the farm and manufacturing censuses.  I have cited secondary records where they appear to be based on primary record sources.

</b></center>



<p><b>1.    Jabez<sup>1</sup> Perkins (Timothy, 2). Born, 6 Nov 1766, in New Haven,
New Haven Co., CT. Died, circa 1836, in Whitley Co., KY. Occupation: farmer.
</b>
</p><pre>      In 1784, George Morris was appointed Guardian to Gebas Perkins (Wilkes
Co., NC, Will Bk 1, p.123). In 1789, Jabish Perkins was administrator of
William Sperry, dec'd. (Wilkes Co., NC, Will Bk 1, p. 254). Inventory of the
Estate of William Sperry is in Wilkes Co., NC Will Bk 1, p. 262 dated 1789. In
1784, Wm. Smith was the Administrator of W. Sperry (Wilkes Co., NC Will Bk 1,
p. 122).

      Between 1784 and 1813, Jabez was in Grayson Co. VA, before removing to
Knox Co., KY.

      Jabez Perkins received Knox Co. Circuit Court Certificate No. 160 for 200
acres of land on 5 Oct. 1813. This is now called Tellico Grant No. 575. It was
surveyed on 24 August 1821 and was in the new county of Whitley on the Gelico
River. He paid off his mortgage for the full price of $20.00 to the
Commonwealth of Kentucky on 22 January 1828. See, Tellico Grants, No. 575, Book
2, page 1, Land Office, Kentucky Secretary of State.

      Sometime after 1830 Jabez and his family moved to the Bureau/Putnam Co., area
of Illinois. Jabez purchased 80 acres of land in Bureau Co., on 13 July 1835
(IL Pub. Dom. Land Tract Sales, Arch. vol. 708, p. 119).  Jesse and William also
purchased 80 acres of land on the same day in the same township as Jabez. Timothy
had purchased two 80 acre tracts in the same township on 20 and 25 June 1835. Jesse
purchased additional tracts of 40, 160 and 80 acres on 7 Sept 1835, and 14 Jan
1836.

      Jabez' son Solomon Perkins may have been the Solomon Perkins who purchased
land in Adams Co., IL, on 27 June 1818.  This was a Military land bounty (IL Pub.
Dom. Land Tract Sales, Arch. vol. 808, p. 481).

Quarter; 8 acres in the Yorkshire Quarter; 2 acres in the Neck in Mr
Lambertson's Quarter; 1/2 of 8 acre meadow at the bottom of Yorkshire Quarter
to divide with Jonathan Perkins; 44 acres of the 2nd Division; 26 acres of the
3rd Division; and, 1/2 right and title in the Ox Pasture and all other
undivided lands. New Haven, CT, Register of Deeds, vol. 1, p. 489).

      Edward Perkins of New Haven, Planter "to loving son Jonathan Perkins"
grant of mansion house where I now dwell together with said son; home lot and
1/2 barn; 3 acres in the Suburbs Quarter; 9 acres in the Suburbs Quarter; 4
acres in the Yorkshire Quarter; 5 acres in the Neck; 1/2 of 8 acres in the
lower end of Yorkshire Quarter to be divided with John Perkins; 44 acres 2nd
Division; 25 acres 3rd Division; and, 1/2 of Edward Perkins interest in Ox
Pasture and all other undivided lands. (New Haven, CT, Register of Deeds, vol.
1, p. 488).

      Edward Perkins of New Haven, Planter, "to loving son David Perkins of New
Haven, cordwainer" grant 4.5 acres in the Suburbs Quarter; 2 acres in the
Yorkshire Quarter; 1 acre of meadow in the Yorkshire Quarter; 1 acre in the
Neck; 12 Acres of 2nd Division; and, 25 acres in the 3rd Division. (New Haven,
CT, Register of Deeds, vol. 1, p. 490).

      All three of these deeds were recorded on 19 November 1690. It is
presumed that Edward died between 25 January 1687/88 and 19 November 1690.
There are only two other deeds from Edward Perkins recorded in the extant New
Haven Register of Deeds. These are to John Perkins, vol. 1, p. 82, and to
Joseph Moss, vol. 1, p. 273. In none of the deeds is a wife mentioned. It is
therefore presumed that she was dead before 1672.

      There is no reference to his estate in either the New Haven Probate
Packets or the New Haven Probate Records.

      He married Elizabeth Butcher (33), 20 Mar 1648/9, in New Haven, New Haven
Co., CT (By Mr Goodyear, New Haven VR, 1:46). Children:

               1688?, in New Haven, CT.
                     It is assumed that Mehitable died young or before marriage
               age since there are no recorded land transactions from Edward
               Perkins to "my son in law" or "in portion of my daughter". He
               did transfer his property to his sons in 1688.

                     On 4 December 1732, administration of his estate was
               granted to Dan'll Perkins on sufficient bond ( New Haven Probate
               Records, volume 6, page 84). An inventory was presented in
               January 1733/4 (New Haven Probate Records, volume 6, page 124).
               Daniel Perkins presented a further account of administration and
               an agreement between the heirs of David Perkins for recording on
               8 January 1733/34. The agreement was accepted as a settlement of
               the estate. It is difficult to read and is not reproduced in
               full. It was signed by the following: William Punchard?;
               Mehitable Punchard, by mark; Dan'll Perkins; Caleb Thomas; David
               Gilbert; and, Experience Gilbert, by mark (New Haven Probate
               Records, volume 6, pages 125-126).
