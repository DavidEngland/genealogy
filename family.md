**Independent Verification:** For the **McDonald** line, the sources suggest searching for the surname **"McDaniel"** in 1850 and 1860 census records, as this was a common clerical error for your kin. Additionally, ensure the **John Lawrence Roberts** death date is reconciled between the Bible (age 96) and the 1861 will.
