==Research Notes==
[[Pleasants-149 | Elizabeth Pleasants (1700 - 1784)]] appears not to be the Elizabeth Pleasants  that married Joseph Lewis. More research needed.

This Joseph and his father were both born in Virginia—he '''cannot''' be the Joseph Lewis born in Bathampton, Somerset, England in 1680.<ref>''Somerset, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1531-1812'', Joseph Lewis.
