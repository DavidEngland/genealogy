From Revolution to the Frontier: The Story of Thomas Gresham

In the annals of American history, some lives serve as a microcosm of the nation's own turbulent birth and relentless drive westward. Such is the story of Thomas Gresham. His journey from a teenage soldier braving the crucible of the Revolutionary War to a pioneer forging a new home on the Alabama frontier offers a personal and compelling window into the country's formative years. By following his path, we can explore the profound forces of war, family, and expansion that shaped the lives of countless individuals, making his story an accessible starting point for understanding not just one family's history, but the broader American experience.

1. A Young Patriot's Call to Arms

Born on December 10, 1761, in Amherst, Colony of Virginia, Thomas Gresham was just 15 years old when he answered the call to arms, enlisting in the Continental Army in 1776 to fight for American independence. He served as a private under Captain Robert Powell, initially with Colonel Thomas Marshall's command, before being integrated into the 3rd Virginia Regiment.

His service was marked by immense hardship and historical significance. Most notably, Thomas endured the brutal winter of 1777-1778 at Valley Forge under the direct command of General George Washington. The physical cost of his service was steep; when he was discharged on February 14, 1778, records show that he was in the hospital at the time. As a reward for his patriotism and sacrifice, he received a grant of land in the promising, yet untamed, territory of Kentucky. With the promise of this land as his reward, Thomas Gresham left the battlefield behind. His next chapter would not be one of war, but of building a family and a future on the Georgia frontier.

2. Building a Family on the Georgia Frontier

After the war, Thomas moved south, where he met and married Mary Thornton in 1793 in Oglethorpe County, Georgia. The couple soon began to build their family, laying the foundation for a new generation of Greshams who would carry their legacy westward. Their family grew rapidly during this period, with children born first in Oglethorpe and later in neighboring Wilkes County.

The first of their ten children included:

* John Gresham (b. 1794 in Oglethorpe Co., GA)
* George Gresham (b. 1796)
* Thomas Gresham Jr. (b. 1798 in Wilkes Co., GA)
* Philemon Gresham (b. 1800 in Wilkes Co., GA)

With a growing family to support, Thomas’s ambition turned toward the west, where the land promised for his military service awaited.

3. The Lure and Peril of the Westward Journey

Around the year 1800, Thomas set out to claim his Kentucky land grant, but the journey proved more perilous than anticipated. Hostile conditions with local Indian tribes made passage unsafe, forcing the family to halt their migration and settle temporarily in Lawrence County, Tennessee. Their efforts to push further west into Alabama were met with repeated setbacks, including being driven back into Tennessee as part of the forceful removal of settlers from Doublehead's reservation, a common U.S. government policy of the era. This difficult period is powerfully substantiated by an official record: he is listed in the 1811 census of the Alabama Territory as living on Indian Land, a testament to his early but tenuous presence in the region.

The family's movements during this turbulent period are outlined below:

Year/Period	Event
Pre-1814	First attempt to settle in Alabama.
~1810-1814	Driven back into Tennessee by Indians and as part of the settler removal from Doublehead's reservation.
Dec 1810	Thomas signed the "Doublehead petition" protesting the removal of white settlers from the reserve.
1816	Final, successful return to Alabama.

After years of struggle and displacement, the family’s perseverance finally allowed them to establish a permanent home.

4. A New Beginning in Lauderdale County

In 1816, Thomas Gresham and his family made their final and successful move into Alabama. He settled on a 160-acre tract of land granted to him by the U.S. Congress, located along Blue Water Creek near what is now Green Hill in Lauderdale County. His arrival marked a significant moment in the region's history, and he is widely considered to be the first white settler in Lauderdale County. This hard-won settlement represented the culmination of a journey that began decades earlier on the battlefields of the Revolution, and this final home would become the site of his family's enduring legacy.

5. The Gresham Legacy: From Soldier to Settler

In a poignant and tragic turn of fate, Thomas Gresham died in 1816, the very same year he finally achieved his lifelong goal of establishing his family's permanent homestead. He and his wife, Mary, are buried in the Gresham Cemetery on the land they settled. In a fascinating genealogical detail, their headstones spell the surname as "Grisham." It is believed this spelling was intentionally adopted to distinguish the family from Loyalists who shared the Gresham name. This practice was not uncommon for Patriots who wished to sever all ties, even nominal ones, with those who remained loyal to the British Crown.

As the father of ten children, Thomas's descendants spread throughout the region, cementing the family's place in the history of northern Alabama. His life encapsulates a quintessential American story—one of military service, relentless perseverance, and the pioneering spirit required to build a new home on the nation's frontier.
