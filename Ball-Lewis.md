**Valentine Ball** (1706–1770) married **Susannah Lewis** (1717–1769) on **January 31, 1733**, in **Middlesex County, Virginia** [1, 2]. Susannah was the daughter of **John Lewis and his wife Mary** [1]. This marriage serves as a foundational link in your lineage, as they were the parents of **Mary Ball** (1749–1813), who married **John Washington Hargrove Sr.** [1-3]. Their son, **Valentine Hargrove**, was named in honor of his grandfather, Valentine Ball [1, 4].

The sources highlight several significant details regarding this union and its legacy:

*   **The Washington Connection:** Through the Lewis and **Warner** families, this marriage connects your ancestors to **George Washington** [5]. Susannah Lewis’s family was closely allied with **Colonel Robert Lewis**, the son of John Lewis and **Elizabeth Warner** [5]. Elizabeth Warner's sister, **Mildred Warner**, was the grandmother of George Washington [5, 6].
*   **Legal Records:** Valentine Ball composed his will in **1769**, which was probated in **1770** in **Amherst County, Virginia** [1]. In this document, he specifically identified his daughter as **Mary Ball Hargrove**, confirming her marriage into the Hargrove (Hargrave) family [1].
*   **Frontier Migration:** The descendants of Valentine Ball and Susannah Lewis were part of the early westward expansion [4, 7]. Their son-in-law, **John W. Hargrove Sr.**, was a magistrate who migrated from Amherst County to **Montgomery County, Virginia**, and eventually into the **Kentucky** frontier [4].
*   **Extended Kinship:** Joseph Francis Lewis, the father of **Ruth Whitley Lewis** (who married Valentine Hargrove), was also part of this influential Lewis network in Virginia and Kentucky [8, 9]. Historical records show **Valentine and Ruth Hargrove** were named as legatees in a **King family estate**, further connecting them to the ancestry of **Winney King**, who was Joseph Francis Lewis's mother [6, 8].
*   **Distinguished Ancestry:** This specific Lewis lineage is documented in heritage records as tracing back to **King John** and several Barons who signed the **Magna Carta**, as well as **William the Conqueror** and **Charlemagne** [6].

I've reviewed your extensive genealogy files. Here's what I found:

## Valentine Ball & Susannah Lewis

**Valentine Ball** (c. 1733–1769/70) married **Susannah Lewis** on **31 January 1733** in Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County, Virginia.

**Susannah's Lewis lineage:** She was the daughter of **John Lewis** and **Mary** of colonial Virginia. The sources indicate she came from the prominent **Virginia Lewis family** associated with the "western aristocracy" that intermarried with **Washington, Warner, and Reade families**. Her lineage traced back through connections to **King John** and the **Magna Carta signers**.

However, **this is NOT the same Lewis line as Joseph Francis Lewis** (the brickmason who married Sarah Whitley). Joseph Francis Lewis married into the Whitley family through **Sarah Whitley**, making him Valentine's brother-in-law by marriage—not a blood relation.

The correct chain for your ancestor **Mary Ball Hargrove** is:
* **Mary Ball** (1749–1813) → daughter of Valentine Ball & Susannah Lewis
* Married **John Washington Hargrove Sr.**
* Had son **James Monroe Hargrove** (1818–1884)
* Whose daughter **Lydia Serena Hargrove** (1854–1897) married **James Ervin White**

## Regarding "Winney King"

**I found no references to "Winney King"** in any of your provided sources.

**However, I found these King family connections:**

1. **Henry Key** (not King) — witnessed Valentine Ball's will and served as co-executor
2. **Martin King Jr.** — mentioned in land records (Hezekiah Hargrove purchased from him in 1780)
3. **King family** mentioned as legatees in a Kentucky estate (possibly Joseph Lewis connection)

**Could you clarify:**
* Where did you see "Winney King" referenced?
* Is it possibly **"Winney"** as a nickname (like for **Winifred**)?
* Or could it be a different spelling like **"Whitney,"** **"Whitfield,"** or **"Whitley"**?

Providing the source citation would help me locate the correct person and their genealogical significance to your line.
