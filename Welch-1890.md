== Biography ==

'''Lewis Welch''' was born in 1780 in North Carolina to [[Welch-185|Nicholas Welch]] (c. 1738–1814) and [[Moore-51757|Elizabeth E. Moore]] (1740–1799). He served as a bridge between his father's Loyalist past and his descendants' integration into the American Republic, fighting for the United States in the War of 1812.

=== Connection to Nicholas Welch ===

Lewis was the son of Major Nicholas Welch, a prominent Loyalist officer who fought for the British at the Battle of Ramsour's Mill during the American Revolution. In stark contrast to his father's British service, Lewis Welch is documented as a veteran of the '''War of 1812''', fighting '''for the United States''' against the very forces his father had once commanded.

=== Migration Path ===

Lewis Welch's migration followed the classic frontier path from North Carolina through South Carolina and Kentucky to Tennessee:

* '''c. 1800:''' Residing in South Carolina (where his son John C. Welch was born)
* '''By 1810:''' Moved to '''Hopkins County, Kentucky''', where he lived next to Henry Welch
* '''By 1820:''' Settled in '''Perry County, Tennessee'''

=== Presence in Perry County, Tennessee ===

Lewis Welch was a central figure in the early settlement of Perry County, Tennessee, part of an expansive Welch family presence in the area.

==== 1820 Census Record ====

The '''1820 Perry County census''' documents Lewis's household:<ref>Tennessee 1850 census records; research by Herb Perry</ref>

* Known sons: '''John C. Welch''' and '''[[Welch-1883|Elijah C. Welch]]'''
* One unknown son
* Three females, one of whom is believed to be his wife (identity remains unknown)

==== Family Network in Perry County ====

Lewis was part of a broader Welch family settlement:

* '''Nicholas Welch Jr.''' (born 1786) - Likely Lewis's brother; one of the vanguard settlers on '''White Oak Creek''' in Perry County between 1818 and 1820; later served as '''Sheriff of Perry County''' after 1830
* '''Zachariah Welch''' - Another relative who held a War of 1812 land grant near the Wayne/Perry County line

This family network suggests coordinated settlement patterns common among War of 1812 veterans who utilized military land grants to establish communities in the Tennessee frontier.

=== War of 1812 Service ===

Lewis Welch served in the War of 1812 for the United States. Specific unit assignments and service dates require further documentation through:

* National Archives, War of 1812 Compiled Service Records
* Kentucky State Archives, War of 1812 pension applications
* Perry County, Tennessee, land grant records (veterans received bounty land)

His service represents the reconciliation of the Welch family with the American Republic, fighting for the nation his father had opposed just one generation earlier.

=== Marriage and Family ===

Lewis married an unknown woman, whose identity remains one of the most significant research gaps in this family line. Through this marriage, he had at least the following children:

* '''John C. Welch''' (b. c. 1800 in South Carolina)
* '''[[Welch-1883|Elijah C. Welch]]''' (1810–1867) - Born in Hopkins County, Kentucky; married Mary Taylor
* One additional son (name unknown, documented in 1820 census)

=== Lineage to Serena Welch ===

Through his son '''[[Welch-1883|Elijah C. Welch]]''' (1810–1867), Lewis became the grandfather of '''[[Welch-1878|Serena Welch]]''' (c. 1833–1884). Serena's marriage to [[Hargrove-279|James Monroe Hargrove]] connected the Welch line (Loyalist heritage) to the family of Patriot Revolutionary War veteran [[Hargrove-261|John Washington Hargrove Sr.]], symbolizing the reconciliation of former enemy families on the Tennessee frontier.

=== Surname Variations ===

The surname appears in records as: Welch, Welsh, Wellch, and Welshe. Researchers should search under all variants to capture complete records.
