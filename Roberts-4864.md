== Biography ==

'''Elizabeth Roberts England''' (July 26, 1792 – aft. 1859) was a descendant of a prominent South Carolina family and matriarch whose lineage became central to the early settlement of the Shoals area in Alabama and the Arkansas frontier.

=== Early Life and Ancestry ===

Elizabeth was born July 26, 1792, in South Carolina, daughter of '''John Lawerence Roberts''' (1765–1861) and '''Sarah Smith''' (1774–1860). Her father, an affluent patriarch, was part of the '''Scots-Irish migration''' from the '''Pendleton District of South Carolina''' to the Tennessee frontier around 1810. The Roberts family maintained a high-quality '''Family Bible'''—originally purchased by her grandfather, '''Jack Smith'''—used to record vital statistics for over a century.<ref>Roberts family bible record (John Roberts and Sarah Smith bible), c. 1813–1826.</ref>

=== Marriage and Children ===

In 1810, while the family was in '''Georgia''', Elizabeth married '''[[England-1055 | John England]]''' (c. 1788–1859).<ref>"United States, Census, 1850", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MCDQ-Y52), Entry for John England and Elizabeth England, 1850.</ref> The couple settled in '''Bedford County, Tennessee''', where their children were born. According to the '''Roberts Family Bible''', their children included:<ref>Roberts family bible record (John Roberts and Sarah Smith bible), recording births c. 1813–1826, with variant spellings Ingland/Ingold/England.</ref>

* '''Sarah Ingold''' (b. 1813)
* '''Malindy Ingland''' (b. 1815), married Absolem Williams
* '''Jonathan Ingland''' (February 15, 1817–aft. 1853), married '''Elizabeth Harper'''
* '''Tilman Ingland''' (b. 1819), pioneer in '''Lauderdale County, Alabama'''
* '''Martin England''' (b. 1821)
* '''Newel England''' (b. 1826), later migrated to Mississippi and Arkansas

=== The Roberts Will and England Orphans ===

Upon his death in 1861 at age 96, '''John Lawerence Roberts''' left a will significantly impacting the England branch. He bequeathed funds to the Englands in '''Lauderdale County, Alabama''', specifically mentioning '''orphans of Jonathan England and Elizabeth Harper'''. This provided financial support for the younger generation, including '''William M. England''', who may have returned to Tennessee to claim his estate share.<ref>England family records; Conversation History</ref>

=== Family Displacement and Cultural Identity ===

Elizabeth's children's migration away from the Roberts home in Tennessee was marked by economic ambition and familial tension.

'''Move to Alabama:''' Tilman, Martin, and their sisters participated in the '''early land grab''' into the '''Shoals area''', settling near '''Cypress Creek''' and the '''Doublehead Reserve''' in the 1830s.<ref>Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresham'', 1976-1977.</ref>

'''Disapproval of Wives:''' Strong family tradition suggests the Roberts family disapproved of wives chosen by '''Tilman''' and '''Newel'''. While '''Tilman's wife, Liza Jane''', remains mysterious in written records, '''Newel England''' descendants suggest marital friction was the primary reason he left the region, moving to Alabama, Mississippi for a while, then Arkansas.<ref>Family oral history; Conversation History</ref>

'''Melungeon or Indigenous Roots:''' Newel's descendants theorize that family disapproval may have stemmed from the cultural or ethnic identity of these wives, specifically suspecting '''indigenous''' or '''Melungeon''' descent. This aligns with broader England family history, which included branches in North Carolina that integrated with the '''ᏣᎳᎩ (Cherokee) Nation'''.<ref>Conversation History; England family genealogical theories</ref>

Elizabeth survived her husband, '''John England''', following his death in 1859. She remains a pivotal figure, linking the stable, affluent Roberts line of South Carolina to the resilient England and McDonald lines in the Shoals.
