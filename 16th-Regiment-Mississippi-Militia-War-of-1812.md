=== Historical Context ===

The Mississippi Militia played a crucial role in defending the southwestern frontier during the War of 1812. The 16th Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Burrus, was part of this defensive effort in the region that would become the Tennessee-Alabama-Mississippi borderlands.

The regiment was associated with early settlers of Northern Madison County, Mississippi, and represents the regional military organization of frontier communities during the war. The relatively short service period (October 1813) reflects the militia's mobilization during a critical phase of the war effort.

The appointment of Valentine Hargrove as Adjutant indicates the administrative complexity of frontier militia units. As adjutant, Hargrove would have been responsible for maintaining regimental records, issuing orders, and managing communications within the regiment—crucial duties during active military service.

=== Historical Note ===

The 16th Regiment (Burrus') Mississippi Militia is '''distinct''' from the '''16th Mississippi Infantry Regiment''', which served in the American Civil War (1861–1865). Researchers should not confuse these two separate military units from different historical periods.
