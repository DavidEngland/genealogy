{{One Name Study|name=Brewer}}
Lanier Brewer Jr. (possibly Lanier John Brewer) was born about 1746. He is associated with Moore County, North Carolina, and may also have connections to Surry County, North Carolina or Virginia. He died about 1824.

== Research Notes ==
* '''Spouses and children (unverified)''': Family tradition reports that Lanier had children by three women, including two wives, and as many as 30 sons and three daughters. Reported spouses include Rebecca Narcissus and a woman named Mary (possibly Mary Elizabeth Russell). These relationships and the full list of children need reliable sources.
* '''Possible children (unverified list)''': Royal, John, George Washington, Henry M., Wiley, Solomon S. (1786), Hester Ann (b. about 1800, married Bradley Brad about 1820), Cornelius, and David Franklin Julius (1794).
* '''Indigenous ancestry claim''': One report states a son, George Brewer, was of Tuckahoe ancestry and used the name “Turkey Ho.” This claim requires documentation.
* '''Possible additional child''': A 2022 note suggests [[Brewer-834|Lewis Brewer]] may be a son of Lanier Brewer with Mary Elizabeth Russell; this is not yet documented.
* '''DNA section verification''': A 2026-02-05 HTML scan of the live profile did not surface a DNA section. The DNA statements below should be verified against current on-profile text and/or reliable DNA project documentation.

== DNA ==
Male Y-DNA testing has been performed on three men who were direct male descendants of [https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Brewer-834 Lewis Brewer].

The Lewis Brewer Group is below the Lanier Brewer Unassigned group about half way down the page, and above the Peter Brewer Group:<br>
<https://www.familytreedna.com/public/BrewerDNA?iframe=ycolorized>

None of those men match the [https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Brewer-710 George Brewer] who married [https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lanier-38 Sarah Lanier].

None of those men match [https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Brewer-2454 Sackfield Brewer] (R-FTA60564) of Brunswick, VA who also had descendants named Lanier Brewer.

There is no proof of any father of Lewis Brewer-834. There is no reason found as yet why he would name a son Lanier Brewer.

There is no proof of any immigration of Lewis Brewer, or his mother from England to America.
