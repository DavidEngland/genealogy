== Biography ==

'''Elizabeth E. Moore''' (1740–1799) was born on March 19, 1740, in North Carolina. She married '''Major Nicholas Welch''' (c. 1738–1814) on 1757 in North Carolina and became a frontier settler in the Tennessee-Kentucky borderlands during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

=== Marriage and Family ===

Elizabeth married '''[[Welch-185|Nicholas Welch]]''', a colonial Pennsylvania landowner who later became a controversial Loyalist officer during the American Revolution. Together they had at least sixteen children, representing a prolific frontier family:

* '''[[Welch-8497|Sarah Welch]]''' (b. 1766, d. 1826)
* '''[[Welch-8495|Judith Welch]]''' (b. 1761, d. 1860)
* '''[[Welch-11475|Nicholas William Welch]]''' (b. 1762, d. 1830)
* '''[[Welch-8498|Thomas Welch]]''' (b. 1765, d. 1810)
* '''[[Welch-8501|William C. Welch]]''' (b. 1758, d. 1838)
* '''[[Welch-8500|Richard Welch]]''' (b. 1770, d. 1861)
* '''[[Welsh-62|Ann Welsh]]''' (b. 1766)
* '''[[Welsh-63|John Welsh]]''' (b. 1769, d. 1830)
* '''[[Welsh-64|Hester Welsh]]''' (b. 1773)
* '''[[Welsh-65|Thomas Welsh]]''' (b. 1775)
* '''[[Welsh-66|Elizabeth Welsh]]''' (b. 1777)
* '''[[Welch-1567|Margaret E Welch]]''' (b. 1765, d. 1841)
* '''[[Welch-1890|Lewis Welch]]''' (b. 1780) — father of [[Welch-1883|Elijah C. Welch]]

=== Life and Migration ===

Elizabeth's life spanned a transformative period in American history. Born in colonial North Carolina, she married during the imperial era and witnessed the American Revolution as the wife of a Loyalist officer. Following the war and Nicholas Welch's loss of colonial property, the family migrated southward through the Carolinas and into Tennessee, eventually settling in Giles County, Tennessee, where she spent her final years.

Her descendants became prominent settlers in the Tennessee-Alabama frontier, including War of 1812 veterans, farmers, and frontier families who established communities in Hardin County, Tennessee, and surrounding regions.

=== Revolutionary War and Exile (1780–1784) ===

Following the British defeat at King's Mountain in October 1780, Elizabeth and her Loyalist husband faced severe consequences from Patriot forces. As the family of a Loyalist officer, Elizabeth, '''Major Nicholas Welch''', and their nine children were banished from North Carolina by Revolutionary authorities.

Exile Route:

* Forced departure from North Carolina (1780)
* Relocation to Georgia, then East Florida
* Settlement in New Providence, Bahamas (1784)

During this period of exile, Elizabeth maintained the family unit while Nicholas petitioned the British government for compensation for their confiscated 600-acre North Carolina estate. Nicholas remained in the Bahamas and London until at least March 1786, when documented petitions show him seeking restitution from the Crown.

=== Separation of the Family: The Bahamas Branch ===

The Welch family experienced a permanent split during the exile period:

'''Those Who Remained in the Islands:'''
* '''[[Welch-15719|Mary Welch]]''' (b. 1762) — Married '''James Misick''' in Nassau, New Providence, in 1785 and remained in the Caribbean, eventually settling in the Turks Islands, where she died in 1822.

'''Those Who Returned to America:'''
Elizabeth herself and most of their children were part of the return migration to the American frontier, though the exact timing and sequence of departures from the Bahamas remains unclear in genealogical records.

=== Return and Settlement in the American Frontier (1800–1814) ===

By the early 1800s, Major Nicholas Welch and his family strategically relocated from the Caribbean back to the American frontier, following a migration corridor through the Carolinas, Kentucky, and into Tennessee.

'''South Carolina (c. 1800):'''
* Major Nicholas Welch and his son '''[[Welch-1890|Lewis Welch]]''' are recorded in South Carolina around 1800, establishing a foothold in the post-war United States.
* Son '''Nicholas Welch Jr.''' was born in Pendleton County, South Carolina, in 1786, suggesting some family presence there even during the Bahamas exile period.

'''Hopkins County, Kentucky (c. 1806–1810):'''
* The family moved into Kentucky by 1810, with '''Lewis Welch''' recorded living next to '''Henry Welch''' in Hopkins County during this period.
* This represents the family's reestablishment in the westward-moving American frontier after more than a decade of Caribbean exile.

=== Settlement Across Tennessee Counties (1810–1814 and Beyond) ===

After establishing a foothold in Kentucky, Elizabeth and her children dispersed across multiple Tennessee counties, each establishing themselves as prominent settlers and War of 1812 veterans:

'''Giles County (Primary Settlement):'''
* '''Major Nicholas Welch''' (Elizabeth's husband) settled here and appears on the 1812 tax list.
* Elizabeth likely spent her final years here with Nicholas.
* Major Nicholas Welch died in Giles County in December 1814.
* Daughter '''[[Welch-8497|Sarah Welch]]''' (b. 1766, d. 1826) remained in Giles County and served as the administratrix of her father's estate.
* Other children including '''[[Welch-8499|John Welch]]''' (d. 1814, Giles County) and '''[[Welch-8498|Thomas Welch]]''' (d. 1810, Tennessee) settled here.

'''Lawrence County (1810s–1820s):'''
* Court records from the 1820s (the "Crockett Docket") contain approximately 50 mentions of the Welch surname, indicating strong family presence.
* Son '''Nicholas Welch Jr.''' married '''Elizabeth Maxey''' in 1819, establishing the family line in Lawrence County.

'''Perry County (Primary Frontier Hub):'''
* '''Nicholas Welch Jr.''' was one of the first settlers on White Oak Creek (1818–1820) and subsequently served as Sheriff of Perry County after 1830.
* '''Lewis Welch''' moved to Perry County by 1820, appearing in the census with his sons, including '''[[Welch-1890|Lewis Welch]]'''.
* '''Zachariah Welch''' settled on the banks of the Tennessee River near the Wayne/Perry line on a War of 1812 land grant, exemplifying the family's prominence as frontier veterans.

'''Hardin County:'''
* Son '''[[Welch-8501|William C. Welch]]''' (b. 1758, d. 1838) settled in Hardin County and is buried in the Savannah Cemetery.
* Grandson '''John C. Welch''' (son of Lewis) was also a resident of Hardin County.
* This county became home to prominent second-generation descendants, including '''[[Welch-1883|Elijah C. Welch]]''' (Elizabeth's great-grandson), who married '''[[Taylor-2744|Mary Taylor]]''' and whose daughter '''[[Welch-1878|Serena Welch]]''' married into the distinguished Hargrove family.

'''Wayne County:'''
* Descendant '''Elijah C. Welch''' (grandson of Major Nicholas) lived in Wayne County, maintaining family connections to multiple Tennessee counties.

'''Gibson County:'''
* Sons '''[[Welch-8500|Richard Welch]]''' (b. 1770, d. 1861) and '''James Welch''' settled here.
* Richard Welch left a will in Gibson County in 1861, indicating long-term family establishment.

=== Legacy: From Exile to Frontier Settlement ===

Elizabeth Moore Welch's life trajectory—from colonial North Carolina through Caribbean exile to Tennessee frontier prominence—embodies the complex experience of Loyalist families during and after the American Revolution. While she and her family lost their original estate through confiscation, they successfully reestablished themselves as prominent frontier settlers, War of 1812 veterans, and community leaders across multiple Tennessee and Kentucky counties.

Her sixteen children and subsequent descendants became instrumental in settling the Tennessee River Valley during the early 19th century, transforming from exiled refugees to foundational frontier families. The dispersal of her children across Giles, Lawrence, Perry, Wayne, Hardin, and Gibson counties represents a deliberate frontier settlement strategy, with each son or family group securing land through military service, land grants, and frontier enterprise.

=== Death ===

Elizabeth died in 1799 in Giles County, Tennessee, at age 59. She is memorialized in Find a Grave records.

== Research Notes ==

* Her maiden name '''Moore''' is well-documented in genealogical records, though specific parentage remains uncertain.
* The Find a Grave record indicates she may be the child of [[Moore-1641|John William Moore (1706–1777)]], but this assertion lacks direct source documentation.
* FamilySearch records contain family tree entries contributed by various users and descendants.
* Her sixteen children by Nicholas Welch represent one of the largest documented frontier families of the colonial-to-early-republic transition period.
