2 CONT ===Overview===
2 CONC '''Sarah Jane "Sallie" Pigg''' was born on July 6, 1875, in Wayne Coun
2 CONC ty, Tennessee, daughter of [[Pigg-84|William T Pigg]] (1842–1888) an
2 CONC d [[Scott-7950|Mary Jane Scott]] (1842–1907). She grew up in a large
2 CONC  farming family and came of age during a time of post-Reconstruction t
2 CONC ransformation in the rural South. In 1893, she married Riley D. Moore,
2 CONC  and together they raised five children while managing a household and
2 CONC  small business in Wayne County.
2 CONT
2 CONC Around the 1920s, the Moore family relocated to Florence in Lauderdale
2 CONC  County, Alabama, where they became long-term residents. Sallie helped
2 CONC  operate their family grocery business, working steadily into her seve
2 CONC nties, and remained deeply involved in her community. She was a charte
2 CONC r member of the Sherrod Avenue Church of Christ and was known for her
2 CONC quiet perseverance and strong family ties.
2 CONT
2 CONC Sallie died in 1951 at the age of 75, after more than three decades in
2 CONC  Florence. At the time of her passing, she was remembered not only as
2 CONC a devoted wife and mother, but as a matriarch who had witnessed the tu
2 CONC rn of a century and helped shepherd her family through it.
2 CONT
2 CONT ===Early Life===
2 CONC In 1880, four-year-old Sallie was living with her parents and ten sibl
2 CONC ings in District 10 of Wayne County, Tennessee. She was listed as the
2 CONC daughter of William Pigg, a 38-year-old farmer, and his wife Mary J. P
2 CONC igg, also 38. The household was large, reflecting a typical rural farm
2 CONC ing family of the period, with older children likely contributing to t
2 CONC he labor required on the farm.
2 CONT
2 CONC Sallie’s siblings included Jasper P. (17), John H. (16), F. M. (14),
2 CONC  Susan C. (13), McDougal (11), Mary C. (10), William (8), Elvira J. (3
2 CONC ), and Ellen (1). All were residing together in the same household, an
2 CONC d several older children were nearing adulthood. Sallie was not yet of
2 CONC  school age.
2 CONT
2 CONC Although this census listed Sallie and most of her siblings as born in
2 CONC  Georgia, this information appears to conflict with data from all othe
2 CONC r records, which consistently indicate that Tennessee is the place of
2 CONC birth for all family members.<ref>

2 CONC By 1930, Sallie and her husband had relocated to Florence in Lauderdal
2 CONC e County, Alabama. They were living at 152 Beulah Avenue, a residence
2 CONC that would remain their home for at least two more decades. Sallie, no

2 CONC  was employed as a merchant, and their son, Riley Jr., age 20, worked
2 CONC as a salesman, likely in the same business. The census marks their tra
2 CONC nsition from rural Tennessee to a more urban setting in northern Alaba

2 CONC Sallie Jane Moore passed away on June 1, 1951, at Eliza Coffee Memoria
2 CONC l Hospital in Florence, Lauderdale County, Alabama, at the age of 75.
2 CONC She had been in declining health for several years, but her final illn
2 CONC ess lasted only a week.
2 CONT
2 CONC Funeral services were held on Sunday, June 3, at 3:00 p.m. at the Sher
2 CONC rod Avenue Church of Christ, where she was a charter member. Minister
2 CONC John D. Cox officiated the service, and she was laid to rest in Floren
2 CONC ce City Cemetery.
2 CONT
2 CONC Sallie was a native of Wayne County, Tennessee, but had been a residen
2 CONC t of Florence for over thirty years. Her life was marked by quiet dedi
2 CONC cation to her family, faith, and local community.
2 CONT
2 CONC She was survived by her husband, Riley D. Moore, Sr.; two sons, Dumont
2 CONC  Moore and Riley D. Moore Jr.; three daughters, Mrs. T. D. Holt, Mrs.
2 CONC B. Townsend, and Mrs. Dorsie Billingsley—all residents of Florence;
2 CONC three sisters, Mrs. W. A. Patterson and Mrs. Henry Lawson of Florence,
2 CONC  and Mrs. J. W. Barclay of Cloverdale; and one brother, William Pigg o
2 CONC f Cloverdale. She also left behind twelve grandchildren and seven grea
2 CONC t-grandchildren, a testament to her enduring family legacy.
2 CONT
2 CONT ==Research Notes==
2 CONC She was often listed as Sally in census records but appears as Sallie
2 CONC in her obituary and burial record, which is, therefore, used throughou
2 CONC t this profile.
2 CONT
2 CONC The 1880 census lists Sallie and family as born in Georgia, but all ot
2 CONC her records consistently state Tennessee. This appears to be an enumer
2 CONC ator error.
