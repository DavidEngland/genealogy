=== Civil War Service ===

During the American Civil War, Randall served from 1862 to 1865 as a Private in the 45th Virginia Battalion Infantry, Confederate States Army.<ref>"Civil War Profiles: The Confusing Confederate Service of Randolph McCoy", by Mathew W. Lively (https://www.civilwarprofiles.com/the-confusing-confederate-service-of-randolph-mccoy/ : accessed 2024).</ref> Between 1863 and 1865, he was a Prisoner of War (POW).<ref>"Virginia Regimental Histories Series", Soldier Detail for Randall McCoy.</ref> 

His Confederate Service Record (CSR) states that he was captured in Pike County, Kentucky, on 8 July 1863 and sent to [[wikipedia:Camp_Chase|Camp Chase]], a Union prison camp in Columbus, Ohio. He arrived there on 20 July 1863 and a month later was transferred to the large military prison at [[wikipedia:Camp_Douglas_(Chicago)|Camp Douglas]] in Chicago, Illinois, where he remained a POW for the remainder of the Civil War.

=== The Hatfield and McCoy Feud ===

Randall McCoy was the patriarch of the McCoy clan involved in the infamous American [[Project:Hatfield_and_McCoy|Hatfield and McCoy Family Feud]]. He lost five of his children to violence during the almost 30-year feud with the Hatfield clan under their patriarch [[Hatfield-260|William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield]].

Kentucky was a border state, but both McCoy and Hatfield families were loyal Confederates, with the exception of Randall's younger brother, [[McCoy-577|Asa]], who enlisted in Company E of the [[wikipedia:45th_Regiment_Kentucky_Infantry|45th Regiment Kentucky Infantry USA]], Union Army.<ref>"National Park Service, Civil War Soldiers and Sailors Database", Soldier Detail for Asa H. McCoy (https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-soldiers-detail.htm : accessed 2024).</ref> Asa was killed on 7 January 1865<ref>{{FindAGrave|125714392|sameas=no}} for Asa Harmon McCoy</ref> by a band called the Logan Wildcats, led by Jim Vance, in what was widely believed to be a Hatfield-led action. This incident began a chain of altercations that would make the names Hatfield and McCoy synonymous with feuding.

The next dispute was a legal one in the late 1870s in which Anderson Hatfield and Randolph McCoy's cousin, [[Cline-1014|Perry Cline]], both held title to a 5,000+ acre tract of land. Hatfield eventually brought a civil suit against Cline. Hatfield won in what was seen by the McCoys as a Hatfield friendly court.

An even bigger event occurred in the fall of 1878 when Randolph "Randall" McCoy brought charges against [[Hatfield-2948|Floyd Hatfield (abt.1847-abt.1926)]] for stealing one of his hogs. <ref> [http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc10/mccoy1.htm#2  Hog Trail Site Marker] </ref> This allegation was a very serious offense at the time. The case was decided in favor of the Hatfields, further inflaming the feud. The primary witness in the affair, related to both sides, was believed killed by the McCoys, although the official verdict was self-defense.

Randall's daughter, [[McCoy-595|Roseanna]], became romantically involved with [[Hatfield-297|Johnse Hatfield]], becoming pregnant with his child. Upon learning of the affair, Randolph disowned her and [[Hatfield-297|Johnse]] married her cousin, [[McCoy-1502|Nancy McCoy]]. Roseanna's baby, [[Hatfield-681|Sarah Elizabeth McCoy]], died before her first birthday, and heart broken, [[McCoy-595|Roseanna]] died at the age of 28.

The peak of the feud occurred on election day in 1882 when three of Randall's sons killed [[Hatfield-262|Ellison Hatfield]]. In retaliation, Devil Anse executed Randall's sons [[McCoy-590|Tolbert]], [[McCoy-597|Pharmer]], and [[McCoy-598|Randolph Jr.]].

One of the most horrific events of the feud occurred on 1 January 1888. Randall's house was burned to the ground and his family attacked as they escaped. His son [[McCoy-596|Calvin]] was killed in the shootout, and his daughter [[McCoy-594|Alifair]] was shot dead as she fled the burning house. When Sally attempted to comfort Alifair, she was severely injured, suffering several broken ribs and skull fractures. Though Randall and the rest of his family retreated into the woods, they were unprepared for the freezing weather and suffered frostbite.

In response to this massacre, Kentucky deputy [[Phillips-3733|Franklin Phillips]] and a posse of McCoys chased down Jim Vance and Cap Hatfield, killing Vance. Nine Hatfield family members and supporters were arrested and jailed.<ref name="The Hatfields Arrive">"The Hatfields Arrive", The Courier-Journal (Louisville, Kentucky), Friday, 17 February 1888, p. 1.</ref>

By the end of the feud, Randall had lost his brother, five of his children, and his wife. He moved his family to Pikeville, Pike County, Kentucky, United States, where he operated a ferry for the remainder of his life.

=== Death ===

In 1914, at the age of 88, Randall slipped near a cooking fire and was severely burned.<ref>"Randall McCoy (1825–1914)", Biography.com (https://www.biography.com/people/randall-mccoy-20824891 : accessed 2024).</ref> McCoy died from his injuries on 28 March 1914 in Pikeville, Pike County, Kentucky, United States, and was buried at Dils Cemetery.<ref>{{FindAGrave|7422518}} for Randolph "Randall" McCoy (30 Oct 1825–28 Mar 1914), Dils Cemetery, Pikeville, Pike County, Kentucky, USA.</ref>

=== Research Notes ===

* A source is needed to confirm exact birth date: either 28 October 1825 or 30 October 1825
* Age at death appears as both 88 and 89 in different sources; birth date confirmation would resolve this discrepancy
