The updated history of the **Gresham** family traces a lineage of resilient pioneers, skilled artisans, and spiritual leaders whose narrative begins in medieval England and becomes central to the settlement of the **Shoals area** in Alabama.

### **English Origins and Modern Corrections**
The family name originated with **Edward De Gresse**, who arrived in England from Normandy in **1066** and fought alongside William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings ``. After settling, the family dropped the French prefix "De" and added "**ham**" (signifying land ownership), adopting a **Coat of Arms** featuring a grasshopper on a green sword ``. While older genealogies often identified the American immigrants **Edward and John Gresham** as the disowned sons of **Sir Edward Gresham of Titsey**, recent research and DNA evidence suggest this is **incorrect**; the disowned sons referenced in historic charts were likely those of Sir Thomas Gresham, and English lawsuits over Sir Edward's estate in **1657** make no mention of any heirs living "across the seas" ``.

### **YDNA and the Immigrant Edward Line**
Modern genetic testing has revolutionized the understanding of the family’s descent. Male descendants of **Edward Gresham "the Immigrant"** (who arrived in Virginia in 1650) belong to **Haplogroup R-M269**, specifically the subgroup **R-BY56690** ``. This biological data distinguishes the American Southern branch from the **Lincolnshire Gresham line** (Haplogroup I-M223), proving they are not related within several millennia ``.

The family’s presence in the Shoals was established by **Thomas Gresham** (1761–1816), a Revolutionary War veteran who served in the **3rd Virginia Regiment** and was present at **Valley Forge** ``. After moving through Georgia and Tennessee, he secured **160 acres along Bluewater Creek** in **1816**, becoming the **first legal white settler** in what is now Lauderdale County, Alabama ``. He was a vocal advocate for early settlers, signing the **1810 Doublehead petition** to protest the federal removal of white families from the Cherokee Reserve ``.

*   **Jarred Gresham (1801–c. 1865):** The son of Thomas and Mary Thornton, Jarred was a farmer who settled in Lauderdale County in **1856** after living in Tennessee ``. He was the father of **William George Gresham**, a Confederate quartermaster who became a prominent **circuit-riding minister** in the Church of Christ, symbolizing the family's postwar spiritual transformation ``.
*   **Philemon Gresham (1800–1850):** An affluent plantation owner whose **1828 home** became a landmark in the **Mars Hill** community ``. His daughter, **Julia Esther Gresham**, married the renowned minister **T. B. Larimore**; together they founded **Mars Hill Academy** on land Esther inherited from the Gresham estate ``. Esther was a noted **choir director** for over 30 years, upholding the Church of Christ tradition of **a cappella** congregational singing `[User Query, 2340, 2341]`.

### **Marital Interconnections**
The Greshams were a cornerstone of the kinship network that defined the early Shoals. The marriage of **Elizabeth Gresham** to **Joseph Manson Rice** in **1821** linked the family to the region's industrial and academic development, producing **Thomas Gresham Rice**, a Professor of Pure Mathematics at **La Grange College** ``. Furthermore, the union of **Mollie Leona Gresham** and **William Archabald "Squire" Parish** solidified the ties between the Gresham, Parish, and Whitten lines, ultimately connecting to your direct **England** lineage through their daughter, **Nancy Pearl Parish** ``.
