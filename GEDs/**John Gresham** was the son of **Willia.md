**John Gresham** was the son of **William and Elizabeth Gresham** and the brother of the Shoals pioneer **Thomas Gresham**. According to the sources, he is identified as a **Revolutionary War veteran** from **Virginia**.

Key details regarding his life and service include:

*   **Military Service:** John was one of **thirteen Greshams from Virginia** who served in the Revolutionary War. While the sources provide extensive details on his brother Thomas's service at Valley Forge, they primarily identify John as a veteran of the same conflict within the family's lineage.
*   **Family Context:** He is listed as the eldest of the siblings in some family accounts (identified as child #47), followed by his brother Thomas (#48) and other siblings including George, Benjamin, and Philemon.
*   **Naming Tradition:** His brother Thomas noted that he named his own children after his brothers and sisters, which further confirms John's place in this specific generation of the Gresham family.
*   **Lineage:** Like Thomas, John was a descendant of **Thomas Gresham (b. 1692)** of Hanover County, Virginia, representing a branch of the family that eventually moved through Georgia and Tennessee before his kinsmen settled in the **Shoals area** of Alabama.

The sources distinguish this John Gresham from the earlier "John Gresham the Immigrant" (1613–1656) who settled in Maryland, though they both belong to the same broader family history.
