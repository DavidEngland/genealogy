2 CONT
2 CONC In September 1962,  Haley became the first journalist to conduct an in

2 CONC In 1976, Alex published ''Roots: The Saga of an American Family'', a n
2 CONC ovel based on his family's history. The novel was eventually published
2 CONC  in 37 languages and he was awarded a special [https://en.wikipedia.or

2 CONT
2 CONC In subsequent years, ''Roots'' became the subject of controversy over
2 CONC its historical accuracy. Critics have pointed out factual errors in th

2 CONC med ancestral link to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunta_Kinte Kunta
2 CONC  Kinte], and highlighted passages shown to be borrowed from Harold Cou
2 CONC rlander’s novel ''The African''. Yet despite these shortcomings, ''R
2 CONC oots'' remains a landmark work for the genealogical community. It igni
2 CONC ted unprecedented public interest in family history, especially among
2 CONC African Americans who had been historically denied access to their anc
2 CONC estral past. By dramatizing the process of tracing one’s lineage acr
2 CONC oss centuries and continents, Haley’s narrative inspired millions to
2 CONC  begin their own genealogical research, fueling both academic studies
2 CONC and the popularization of genealogy as a personal and cultural pursuit
2 CONC . In this sense, ''Roots'' endures less as a literal family history an
2 CONC d more as a catalyst that underscored the importance—and the power�
2 CONC �of reconnecting with one’s roots.

2 CONT
2 CONC The identification of Susan's genealogical data is an interesting stor
2 CONC y.  For most of recent times, the only evidence for the existence of S
2 CONC usan was a bequest in her father James's will.  The will names Sarah B
2 CONC lack and several "natural" children, including "Susan Martin". It is c
2 CONC ommonly assumed that James had children with Sarah Black after the pas
2 CONC sing of his wife Mary but never married Sarah.  From this, we conclude
2 CONC  that Susan was born after Mary's death in 1784 and that she married a
2 CONC  man named Martin.
2 CONT
2 CONC By the early twenty-first century, this was all that was known of Susa
2 CONC n.  Then on March 17, 2018, a letter was discovered written by Lillian
2 CONC  Virginia Koller sometime in the early twentieth century in which she
2 CONC states that she has a bible passed down to her from her mother's grand
2 CONC mother.  Included in the letter is a partial transcription of the bibl
2 CONC e listing birth dates for all twelve of James Jackson's legitimate chi
2 CONC ldren with Mary.  Researching backward from her led to the identificat
2 CONC ion of her mother's mother's parents as Charles Martin and Susan Jacks
2 CONC on, thereby closing the loop.
2 CONT
2 CONC No likely candidate has yet appeared for a census record showing the h
2 CONC ousehold of Charles Martin.  The 1855 New York State Census record for
2 CONC  their daughter Eliza indicates that she was born in Putnam, New York<
2 CONC ref>The handwriting is messy, and even if "Putnam" was correctly ident
2 CONC ified, it is unclear if this is Putnam County or the town of Putnam fu
2 CONC rther north in Washington County.</ref>, so it appears the couple was
2 CONC in Putnam in the early 1820s.
2 CONT
2 CONT Lillian Koller's letter states:
2 CONC : My grandmother's youngest sister lived in Virginia and at the time o
2 CONC f her mothers death and after lived in the old house and took the fami
2 CONC ly silver. My grandmother never received her share as her sister gave
2 CONC it to the Confederate States to be melted
2 CONC Lillian goes on to say that a pitcher and spoon bearing the family cre
2 CONC st had been passed down, however. This is clearly referring to the jac
2 CONC kson crest, so the grandmother being discussed is seemingly Susan's da
2 CONC ughter Eliza. It would seem then that Susan had multiple children and
2 CONC perhaps lived in Virginia for a time — at least her youngest daughte
2 CONC r did.

2 CONC Eliza has no known birth record, and her birth year fluctuates a littl
2 CONC e in census records.  But of these census records, the federal census
2 CONC of 1900 required the most detailed accounting and indicates she was bo
2 CONC rn in December 1818.  Her birth location also changes between New York
2 CONC  and Ireland, but we again trust the precision of the 1900 federal cen
2 CONC sus which says that she was born in Ireland and immigrated in 1821.
2 CONT
2 CONC From census records, we see that Eliza married Charles Cunningham prob
2 CONC ably in the early 1840s.  They had children James, George, Susan, and
2 CONC William Cunningham.  Charles passed away around 1853 or 1854.
2 CONT
2 CONC Eliza then married widower Nicholas Van Pelt sometime between 1855 and
2 CONC  1859.  They had children Elizabeth and Edward.  The US federal census
2 CONC  of 1910 indicates that she had 8 children, so there are two unaccount
2 CONC ed for in the above enumeration.
2 CONT
2 CONC Eliza passed away in 1911, leaving a [[#will|will]] written December 1
2 CONC 5, 1910 and proved March 27, 1911 (the process was initiated on Januar
2 CONC y 26, 1911). It names
2 CONT * son George W. Cunningham, deceased
2 CONC * George's children Elizabeth Berry and Sarah, Edith, and Frances Cunn
2 CONC ingham
2 CONT * daughter Elizabeth J. Decker
2 CONT * Elizabeth's children Freeman D. and Harry W. Decker

2 CONT * son Edwin J. Van Pelt, deceased
2 CONT * Edwin's daughter Mary Van Pelt
2 CONT * daughter Susan V. Simonson
2 CONT * susan's daughter Lillian V. Koller
2 CONC Executor was Theodore Irving Simonson.  Witnesses were Melvin D. Decke
2 CONC r and Geo. H. Roberts.
2 CONT
2 CONC Eliza's death record states that she died on 14 January 1911 at 1063 P
2 CONC ost Ave in Port Richmond.<ref>Death certificate for Eliza Van Pelt, Ri
2 CONC chmond (Staten Island), NYC, certificate no. 111 for 1911; [https://a8
2 CONC 60-historicalvitalrecords.nyc.gov/view/4396029 digital image] availabl
2 CONC e through "Historical Vital Records", database and images by The New Y
2 CONC ork City Municipal Archives</ref> This was 12 days before the initiati
2 CONC on of her probate process.
2 CONC The records gives her exact age at death of 92 years, 1 month, 6 days,
2 CONC  giving an inferred birth date of 8 December 1818. It states she was w
2 CONC idowed, born in Ireland, resident in the US for 89 years, and resident
2 CONC  in New York City for 15 years. It lists her parents as Charles Martin
2 CONC  and Susan Jackson, both born in Ireland.  This information partially
2 CONC corroborates the contents of a letter penned by Lillian Virginia Kolle
2 CONC r. <ref>This corroboration is explained in detail at Eliza's mother [[
2 CONC Jackson-27869|Susan Jackson's]] profile</ref>.
2 CONT The record states that she was buried in Moravian Cemetery.
2 CONT
2 CONC There is one additional census record that deserves further research.
2 CONC  Eliza is difficult to find in the 1905 New York state census.  One ca
2 CONC ndidate for her record is a Lizzie Van Pelt, 83 years old, boarding in
2 CONC  the household of Charles Martin in Brooklyn.  It is striking that he
2 CONC has the same name as her father.  This younger Charles Martin was the
2 CONC son of Francis I. Martin and Margaret Weiner.
