2 CONT {{US Southern Colonist Sticker|Virginia}}
2 CONT
2 CONC '''Mary Ball''' was born in '''1749''' in '''Henrico County, Colony of
2 CONC  Virginia'''. She was the daughter of '''[[Ball-532|Valentine Ball]]''
2 CONC ' (1706–1770) and '''[[Lewis-1457|Susannah Lewis]]''' (1717–1769).
2 CONC  Her parents were married in Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County, o
2 CONC n January 31, 1733.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Siblings ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Mary was named as a legatee in her father's will, composed on January
2 CONC 12, 1769, and probated in '''Amherst County, Virginia''', on March 5,
2 CONC 1770. According to the will and family records, she was sister to:
2 CONT * '''[[Ball-524|James Ball]]'''
2 CONT * '''[[Ball-534|Lewis Ball]]'''
2 CONT * '''[[Ball-576|John Ball]]'''
2 CONT * '''[[Ball-518|William Ball]]'''
2 CONT * '''[[Ball-10876|Alice (Ball) Edmonds]]''' (also recorded as Wright)
2 CONT * '''[[Ball-573|Sarah (Ball) Bowman]]'''
2 CONT * '''[[Ball-25263|Sarah Ball]]''' (half sibling)
2 CONT * '''[[Ball-16642|Elizabeth Ball]]''' (married a Hughes)
2 CONT * '''Jane Ball'''
2 CONT
2 CONT === Father's Estate and Will ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Valentine Ball's will, dated '''January 12, 1769''', provides detailed
2 CONC  insight into the distribution of his frontier estate and reveals impo
2 CONC rtant information about Mary's married status:
2 CONT
2 CONT '''Primary Heirs and Major Bequests:'''
2 CONC * '''Susanna Ball (Wife):''' Granted a '''life interest in the entire
2 CONC estate''' and served as '''Executrix''', ensuring control of the plant
2 CONC ation during her lifetime.
2 CONC * '''William Ball (Son):''' Bequeathed the '''land and plantation''' w
2 CONC here Valentine lived, to be received after his mother's decease.
2 CONC * '''Jane Ball (Daughter):''' Bequeathed '''all household goods, lives
2 CONC tock (horses, cattle, sheep, hogs)''', and an '''enslaved man named Wi
2 CONC ll''', also to be received after her mother's death.
2 CONT
2 CONC '''Children Receiving Nominal Bequests (One Shilling Sterling Each):''
2 CONC '
2 CONC Following standard legal practice to prevent challenges to the will, V
2 CONC alentine left '''one shilling sterling''' each to:
2 CONT * '''James Ball'''
2 CONT * '''Lewis Ball'''
2 CONT * '''John Ball'''
2 CONT * '''Alice Wright'''
2 CONT * '''Sarah Bowman'''
2 CONT * '''Susannah Heughs'''
2 CONT * '''Elizabeth Heughs'''
2 CONC * '''Mary Hargrove''' — '''identified as the wife of John Washington
2 CONC  Hargrove''', confirming her married status by 1769.
2 CONT
2 CONT '''Executors and Witnesses:'''
2 CONC * '''Captain Henry Key:''' Appointed as '''Executor''' alongside Susan
2 CONC na Ball; bequeathed '''five shillings'''.
2 CONT * '''Witnesses:''' Mary Key, Judith Tolley, and William Bishnell.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Marriage and Family ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Mary married '''[[Hargrove-261|John Washington Hargrove Sr., Esq.]]'''
2 CONC  (ca. 1750–1838). While an exact marriage date and location are not
2 CONC documented in available primary records, significant evidence confirms
2 CONC  the marriage was established by '''1769''':
2 CONT
2 CONC '''Primary Evidence:''' Mary is specifically identified as '''"Mary Ha
2 CONC rgrove"''' in her father's will dated '''January 12, 1769''', definiti
2 CONC vely confirming her married status before his death and probate on '''
2 CONC March 5, 1770'''.
2 CONT
2 CONC '''Geographic Context:''' Mary was born in '''Henrico County''' (1749)
2 CONC , but the family relocated to '''Amherst County, Virginia''' in the 17
2 CONC 60s. Given that John Washington Hargrove Sr. was a product of the Virg
2 CONC inia frontier and served as a '''Minuteman in Amherst County''', the m
2 CONC arriage likely occurred in either '''Henrico''' or '''Amherst County''
2 CONC ' during the family's tenure there.
2 CONT
2 CONC '''Strategic Alliance:''' This union represented a pivotal '''"Hargrov
2 CONC e Alliance,"''' merging the established '''Ball-Lewis network''' with
2 CONC the '''Hargrove line'''. This alliance facilitated the family's later
2 CONC migration to '''Pulaski County, Kentucky''', where Mary eventually die
2 CONC d.
2 CONT
2 CONC Her husband was a magistrate who eventually migrated with the family f
2 CONC rom Amherst and Montgomery Counties, Virginia, to the '''Kentucky fron
2 CONC tier'''.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Children ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Mary and John Washington Hargrove had a large family, including at lea
2 CONC st five sons who became prominent on the frontier:
2 CONT
2 CONC * '''[[Hargrove-273|William Hargrove]]''' (b. 1773): A captain in the
2 CONC '''Indiana Rangers''' and a noted Indian fighter.
2 CONC * '''[[Hargrove-274|John W. Hargrove Jr.]]''' (b. 1775): Who served as
2 CONC  sheriff of '''Claiborne County, Tennessee''', for sixteen years.
2 CONT * '''[[Hargrove-275|James B. Hargrove]]''' (b. ca. 1776).
2 CONC * '''[[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]]''' (b. ca. 1778): Named for M
2 CONC ary's father; he was characterized as a "good warrior" who served alon
2 CONC gside his uncle-in-law, Col. William Whitley.
2 CONT * '''[[Hargrove-259|Lindsey Hargrove]]''' (b. 1780).
2 CONT
2 CONT === Death ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Mary Ball Hargrove died in '''1813''', likely in '''Pulaski County, Ke
2 CONC ntucky''', where the family had established residency.
2 CONT
2 CONT == Research Notes ==
2 CONT
2 CONC * '''Marriage Record Gap:''' While no single marriage record (with spe
2 CONC cific date and location) has been located for Mary Ball and John Washi
2 CONC ngton Hargrove Sr., the evidence of their union before 1769 is conclus
2 CONC ive. The 1769 will of Valentine Ball remains the primary documentary p
2 CONC roof of their established marriage during colonial Virginia. The will'
2 CONC s specific identification of Mary as "Mary Hargrove" provides legal do
2 CONC cumentation of her married name.
2 CONT
2 CONC * '''Washington Connection:''' While family tradition often claims a c
2 CONC lose blood tie to George Washington through the Ball family, research
2 CONC indicates there is '''no evidence''' to link Mary's father, Valentine
2 CONC Ball, to the specific Ball lineage of George Washington's mother. The
2 CONC connection to the Washingtons is instead more reliably traced through
2 CONC the '''Lewis and Warner''' intermarriages.
2 CONT
2 CONC * '''Birth Date Correction:''' Mary was born in '''1749''', not 1780.
2 CONC A birth in 1780 would make her too young to be the daughter of Valenti
2 CONC ne Ball (d. 1770) or the mother of William Hargrove (b. 1773).
2 CONT
2 CONC * '''Frontier Planter Culture:''' Valentine Ball's will illustrates ''
2 CONC 'gendered inheritance patterns''' typical of eighteenth-century Virgin
2 CONC ia frontier planters, with major real property and chattels distribute
2 CONC d to male heirs or retained by the widow for life, while daughters rec
2 CONC eived nominal bequests or household goods.

2 CONC One of the stories in the Draper Manuscripts was about William Hartgro
2 CONC ve who went with Col., William and Whitley to Cherokee towns to get Wh
2 CONC ite prisoners from among the Cherokees. While there some of the Indian
2 CONC s took the bell off Whitley's horse and one of them tied it around his
2 CONC  neck and rattled it; others painted themselves. Whitley sternly asked
2 CONC  what they meant by it; they replied, "it means fighting, it means kil
2 CONC ling you." Whitley turned to Hartgrove and asked him if could fight. H
2 CONC artgrove replied, "Yes he could fight til he died." The Indians impres
2 CONC sed with their determination, and courage complemented them as good wa
2 CONC rriors and walked away. In the Col. William Whitley papers, Whitley ca
2 CONC lled William Hartgrove a Range Captain. In 1799 William was given a la

2 CONC There was so much trouble in different parts of the territory, especia

2 CONC e several detachments of scouts and rangers, hoping in that way to che

2 CONC t Vincennes. There were also a number of friendly Indians belonging to
2 CONC  the Piankashaws, Weas and Delawares who were used as messengers.
2 CONC This information and letters were kept by Captain William Hargrove, co

2 CONC Last Saturday, the 4th inst. A number of friendly Indians were in to s
2 CONC ee the celebration of Independence Day. A half-breed Delaware Indian n
2 CONC amed “Swimming Otter” reported that there was likely to be a raid
2 CONC made by young Indian hunters on boats loaded with people and their plu
2 CONC nder coming to this section by the Wabash or going down the Ohio river
2 CONC . He said that the band would be led by an Indian who lost his father
2 CONC in a battle with a boat crew near the Red Banks (now Henderson, KY). T
2 CONC he scouts thoroughly interrogated the Indian and he has promised to le
2 CONC t them know the time they are to start and the route they will follow.
2 CONC  The raiders will not get started, so the half-breed says, in less tha
2 CONC n 10 days and that he will be here two or three days before they go. Y
2 CONC ou will then be informed by a runner so that you can thwart their desi
2 CONC gns if they attempt to cross your territory. It is reported here by fr
2 CONC iendly Indians that a band of Miami Indians captured a boat on the Ohi
2 CONC o river some 40 miles below Clarksville and captured the crew, killing
2 CONC  two men and carrying two women and four children into captivity. You
2 CONC can do no better than you have. Thoroughly patrol the three traveled w

2 CONC In a letter to Governor Posey which was written at Jeffersonville on A

2 CONC Your report and the man you sent in under guard are here. You did the

2 CONC  it is doubtful if it ever is. If this country were at war with a whit

2 CONT == Biography ==
2 CONT
2 CONC '''Valentine Hargrove''' was born around '''1778''' in '''Amherst, Vir
2 CONC ginia'''. He was the son of '''John Washington Hargrove''' (age 27 at
2 CONC Valentine's birth) and '''Mary Ball''' (age 31 at Valentine's birth).
2 CONC He was an early settler on the Kentucky frontier with close connection
2 CONC s to the influential '''Whitley family''' through his marriage to '''[
2 CONC [Lewis-8883|Ruth Whitley Lewis]]'''.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Marriage ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Valentine married '''Ruth Whitley Lewis''' on '''9 October 1799''' in
2 CONC '''Lincoln County, Kentucky'''. Ruth was the daughter of '''[[Lewis-98
2 CONC 41|Joseph Francis Lewis]]''', a skilled brickmason, and '''[[Whitley-7
2 CONC 53|Sarah Whitley]]''', sister of the famed Kentucky pioneer '''[[Whitl
2 CONC ey-757|William Chapman Whitley]]'''. The marriage was witnessed by '''
2 CONC Samuel Lewis''' and '''James Hardgrove'''.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Frontier Life and Family Narratives ===
2 CONT
2 CONC As an early settler on the Kentucky frontier, Valentine was closely co
2 CONC nnected to the pioneering efforts of the Whitley family. Family tradit
2 CONC ion records that Valentine traveled with his brother-in-law '''William
2 CONC  Whitley''' to Cherokee towns to secure the release of white prisoners
2 CONC  taken during frontier conflicts. During one such peace mission, the p
2 CONC arty was threatened by warriors. Valentine reportedly demonstrated suc
2 CONC h resolve when asked if he could fight that the Indians complimented h
2 CONC im as a '''"good warrior"''' and permitted the group to return home wi
2 CONC th several prisoners.
2 CONT
2 CONC This account reflects Valentine's character and his participation in t
2 CONC he dangerous and complex negotiations that characterized early frontie
2 CONC r relations with Native American tribes.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Children ===
2 CONT
2 CONT Valentine and Ruth had '''at least ten children''':
2 CONT
2 CONT * '''Mary Hargrove'''
2 CONT * '''Ruth Hargrove'''
2 CONC * '''[[Hargrove-284|Elizabeth Louisiana Hargrove]]''' (1804–1862); s
2 CONC ettled in Missouri
2 CONT * '''[[Hargrove-285|Samuel Ball Hargrove]]''' (b. 1806)
2 CONT * '''Sarah Hargrove'''
2 CONC * '''[[Hargrove-286|William Wesley Hargrove]]''' (1816–1876); died i
2 CONC n Oregon
2 CONT * '''[[Hargrove-287|James Monroe Hargrove]]''' (1818–1884)
2 CONT * '''[[Hargrove-288|Omar Hassen Hargrove]]''' (1820–1865)
2 CONT * '''[[Hargrove-290|John Lindsey Hargrove]]''' (1826–1902)
2 CONT * '''[[Hargrove-291|Jackson Hargrove]]''' (b. ca. 1830)
2 CONT
2 CONT === Migration to Tennessee ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Following his marriage to Ruth, Valentine and his family eventually mi
2 CONC grated southward into the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands. This southwar
2 CONC d movement represents the broader pattern of frontier settlement expan
2 CONC sion during the early 19th century, as settlers moved from the establi
2 CONC shed Kentucky frontier into new territories.
2 CONT
2 CONC Valentine established his home in '''Hardin County, Tennessee''', wher
2 CONC e the family resided for approximately ten years. By 1850, Valentine w
2 CONC as living in '''Crossroads, Hardin County, Tennessee'''.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Military Service ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Valentine served in the '''War of 1812''' as '''Adjutant of the 16th R
2 CONC egiment (Burrus') Mississippi Militia'''. The Mississippi Militia play
2 CONC ed a crucial role in defending the southwestern frontier during the wa
2 CONC r, particularly in the region that would become the Tennessee-Alabama-
2 CONC Mississippi borderlands.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Death ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Valentine died between '''1856 and 1860''' in '''Hardin County, Tennes
2 CONC see'''. Some sources indicate '''Savannah, Hardin County, Tennessee'''
2 CONC , though this requires further verification through primary documentat
2 CONC ion.

2 CONC r "the land of Virginia"<ref>merchant ship Bonaventure St Domingo than
2 CONC  VA 1634 passenger list; https://www.packrat-pro.com/ships/bonaventure
2 CONC .htm</ref>.  She was a reasonably large ship,about the same size as th
2 CONC e Mayflower, which displaces 180 tons with a length of 90 feet and a m
2 CONC aximum width of 24 feet.  She was carrying 166 passengers, most of the
2 CONC m indentured servants whose ages ranged from 58 to 4 years. Her first
2 CONC stop was the customs port of Gravesend, 20- odd miles down the River T
2 CONC hames, which in those days was still pronounced the way it is spelled.
2 CONC  Customs searchers and a doctor came aboard there, to see that none of
2 CONC  the servants was being shanghaied or carrying the plague.  There was
2 CONC also a Registry Office man to fill out their indentures, and the Episc
2 CONC opal minister of Gravesend to question them all concerning their confo
2 CONC rmity to the orders and discipline of the Established Church of Englan
2 CONC d.
2 CONT
2 CONC The seventh man in the lineup was, from his broad accent, a Yorkshirem
2 CONC an. He gave his name as Richard Hargrave, his age as 20. When he had p
2 CONC assed his test, and signed his indenture, and taken the Oath of Allegi
2 CONC ance, he had literally sold himself down the river.
2 CONT
2 CONC The word "servant" was quite respectable in England, though we would s
2 CONC ay "employee" instead, and "indentures" were simply an employment cont
2 CONC ract - voluntary, sensible and fair - adapted from the highly successf
2 CONC ul apprenticeship system.  Richard Hargrave's agreement was probably w
2 CONC ith the ship's Captain, James Ricroft, who would sell it to a third pa
2 CONC rty when they reached Virginia. It bound Richard to work, under agreed
2 CONC  conditions and restrictions, for an agreed period of time beginning w
2 CONC ith his arrival there.  The usual term of service at that time was, fo
2 CONC r persons 20 and over, four years; those under 20, five years; childre
2 CONC n under 12, seven years.  Ricroft, in return, would supply his passage
2 CONC , food and necessary gear.  And, at the end of the work period, the em
2 CONC ployer would furnish him sufficient provisions, clothing and equipment
2 CONC  to start out on his own.
2 CONT
2 CONC For Captain Ricroft the cost of recruiting, transporting and feeding t
2 CONC his likely-looking young North Country lout would be L6 sterling at mo
2 CONC st, and probably closer to L5.  As best I can figure it out, L5 sterli
2 CONC ng in 1635 would be worth perhaps $400 in the money of today.  Real mo
2 CONC ney, though, was practically nonexistent in Virginia except for a few
2 CONC Spanish dollars, called "pieces of eight," or an occasional Dutch or F
2 CONC rench coin.  The real currency was tobacco, cured and in cast, which w
2 CONC as still bringing sixpence a pound.  Twelve pounds of tobacco would co
2 CONC me to 6 shillings, and 6 shillings was the equivalent of 1 Spanish dol
2 CONC lar.  Richard's contract could be sold there for probably 600 pounds o
2 CONC f tobacco, representing L15 sterling, a net profit of 200 per cent. As
2 CONC suming, that is, that Richard got there at all.  The voyage itself was
2 CONC  usually three months of seasickness, overcrowding, rats and lice, scu
2 CONC rvy and pestilence, and usually one passenger of every five would die
2 CONC between Gravesend and the Hampton Roads.
2 CONT
2 CONC Those were the odds against the captain.  For Richard, getting there w
2 CONC as less than half the battle.  The whole Eastern seaboard of America w
2 CONC as one vast thickset forest, so dense that you could smell the pine ne
2 CONC edles from 150 miles at sea; and a squirrel, they say, could have trav
2 CONC eled cross country from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, tree to tree,
2 CONC  without ever coming to ground.  The settled portions of Virginia, non
2 CONC e of which extended farther than half a mile back from the various riv
2 CONC ers, consisted mostly of brackish water, mosquitoes and dysentery.  Th
2 CONC e year was divided into two seasons: malaria and flu. Often, in the ea
2 CONC rly times, four out of every five newcomers died within a year.
2 CONT
2 CONC Richard Hargrave survived for more than half a century.  He started a
2 CONC family that is now enormous, and he was moderately prosperous, and he
2 CONC worried less about the Tidewater climate than about the everlasting fl
2 CONC ames of Hell.  He started out with great luck, or marvelous timing, or
2 CONC  both.  He came before the days of overcrowded ships and exploited man
2 CONC power, and sold his labor in a seller's market.
2 CONT
2 CONC He was obviously bright and personable, healthy or at least very durab
2 CONC le.  He was venturesome, and he knew his way around.  That was the Yor
2 CONC kshire in him.  "Give a Yorkshireman a halter," they used to say, " an
2 CONC d he'll find a horse."  Whatever future he envisioned, that cold Janua
2 CONC ry morning off Gravesend, it did not include the endless chopping of s
2 CONC omeone else's weed in the hot sun.
2 CONT
2 CONC Incoming ships were suppose to proceed up the James River to "James Ci
2 CONC ty" before breaking bulk, but many captains liked to dawdle awhile at
2 CONC Old Point Comfort and Newport News instead, wetting down old thirst an
2 CONC d making deals with old customers before lugging the rest of their sto
2 CONC ck to the boondocks.  Master Ricroft was not above this sort of jugger
2 CONC y-pokery.  In 1631, while still pilot of the Elizabeth, he and several
2 CONC  associates had been had up before His Majesty's Privy Council for ill
2 CONC egal trading in Canada, a monopoly that His Majesty had already sold t
2 CONC o somebody else.  Be that as it may, it was at Point Comfort, his firs
2 CONC t landfall, that young Hargrave favorably impressed Mr. Henry Sewell,
2 CONC a respected merchant of that neighborhood, who straightway bought his
2 CONC indenture and packed him off to the shop.
2 CONT
2 CONC Sewell was a churchwarden of Elizabeth River Parish, across the James,
2 CONC  and in 1638, after it became Lower Norfolk County, a justice of the c
2 CONC ounty court. His household and his business were at a place still call
2 CONC ed Sewell's Point. Besides Richard and other employees, the Sewells ha
2 CONC d an infant daughter named Ann, and there was a Henry Jr. a little lat
2 CONC er on.  Richard's service there seems to have been mercantile rather t
2 CONC han horticultural, and apparently it worked out well for all.  Althoug
2 CONC h Mr. and Mrs. Sewell both died in the winter of 1644, contact was mai
2 CONC ntained between the two families for at least two generations.
2 CONT
2 CONC From Sewell's Point, Richard went into business for himself.  He had a
2 CONC  tobacco crop, of course, because that's what Virginia was there for,
2 CONC but also some sort of rural store somewhere on the Elizabeth River.  T
2 CONC he word "rural" is redundant;  except for the malarial little village
2 CONC of James City, there wasn't a town anywhere in the colony, nor even a
2 CONC brick building until 1639.  It must have been a very small business; a
2 CONC lthough at least a third of the county court's business was in collect
2 CONC ing people's debts, it was not until late 1646 that Richard Hargrave g
2 CONC ot around to suing a creditor, and then it was for 22 shillings 4 penc
2 CONC e (say $3.67). Though hardly an enterprise of great pith and moment, t
2 CONC hat was Richard's first appearance in the public records since Gravese
2 CONC nd: twelve years that were the richest and most eventful of his whole
2 CONC life.  Piecing together later fragments, we can deduce that he became
2 CONC his own man in the early spring of 1639, four years after his arrival.
2 CONT
2 CONC Within a year after that, he married.  In 1642, at the latest, he was
2 CONC the father of a son and namesake.  And in October 1646 he achieved wha
2 CONC t most Englishmen before him never had: he owned the land he lived on.
2 CONC  It was a tract of 150 acres, of which perhaps as many as 144 were den
2 CONC se woods and under-brush, on the north side of Broad Creek, on the Eas
2 CONC tern Branch of the Elizabeth River.  It had originally been granted to
2 CONC  John Watkins, who sold it to Richard.  Beginning at a marded pine tre
2 CONC e on a point in the creekside, his line extended north-northeast exact
2 CONC ly a mile (320 poles) to a gum, thence west-southwest 75 poles to a pi
2 CONC ne, south-southwest 320 poles to a gum on a point on the west side of
2 CONC the mouth of a small gut, thence east-northeast "by  or nigh on" the m
2 CONC ain branch side to the beginning.  There was another 100 acre piece av
2 CONC ailable on the east side, and Richard was granted a patent for that to
2 CONC o in 1652--"by and for transporting of two persons into this colony."
2 CONT
2 CONC The whole place has gone downhill since then, of course.  A sizable to
2 CONC wn has sprung up over the past 300 years.  And most of Richard's 250 a
2 CONC cres of solid shade have been taken over by a housing development or s
2 CONC omething, called River Oaks, a mile or so south of the airport, in the
2 CONC  city of Norfolk.
2 CONT
2 CONT RICHARD IN THE PARISH
2 CONT
2 CONC Richard Hargrave was a Puritan, and had been, I suspect, since his boy
2 CONC hood in West Riding.  The clothing towns of Yorkshire were full of Pur
2 CONC itans.  The countryside, as a rule, was not.
2 CONT
2 CONC Somehow the idea has got around that the Puritans were a small elite g
2 CONC roup of the Lord's Anointed who in late 1620 landed in the suburbs of
2 CONC Boston, where, pausing only to register for the DAR and proclaim thems
2 CONC elves the beginning of American history, they quickly ventured in demo
2 CONC cracy, freedom of worship (for Puritans), Thanksgiving, turkeys, witch
2 CONC  burning and wooden nutmeg.  Actually, there were millions of Puritans
2 CONC  in England, all of them nominally Episcopalian, but the church had be
2 CONC come an arm of the government, and the two were so intertwined that it
2 CONC  was hard to hate the Archbishop of Canterbury without despising the K
2 CONC ing as well, a vice versa.  Any Englishman who suspected that the Prot
2 CONC estant Reformation had somehow passed the English by, or who was at al
2 CONC l skeptical about the Divine Right of Kings, was contemptuously define
2 CONC d as a Puritan, a Presbyterian, a Roundhead.
2 CONT
2 CONC By 1640, it is estimated, about 7 per cent of all Virginians were Puri
2 CONC tans. There had been anti-Puritan laws there since 1631, but not very
2 CONC conscientiously enforced - until things began heating up in England, a
2 CONC nd the established crowd ("Cavaliers") constantly losing ground to the
2 CONC  Roundheads of Parliament, the cities and the army.
2 CONT
2 CONC In 1642, just about the time King Charles I blundered into open civil
2 CONC war, he appointed as governor of Virginia Sir William Berkley, "a stau
2 CONC nch royalist and a narrow churchman," who kept Virginia a royalist enc
2 CONC lave long after Charles had been deposed and his kingdom replaced by a
2 CONC  republican Puritan commonwealth. Sir William persecuted his own Purit
2 CONC ans with great vigor and zest.  In 1649 alone, the year King Charles w
2 CONC as convicted of high treason and his head chopped off, about 1000 Puri
2 CONC tans fled Virginia for Maryland and New England and were replaced the
2 CONC same year by about 1000 refugee Cavaliers welcomed by Berkley.
2 CONT
2 CONC During all the demolition and slaughter of the Civil Wars in England,
2 CONC there were colorful little sidelights in Lower Norfolk County.  The mi
2 CONC nister there was a promising young Episcopal clerk,  Mr. Thomas Harris
2 CONC on.  At one point Harrison had been chaplain to Sir William himself, a
2 CONC nd parishioners described him as "an able minister and a man of splend
2 CONC id character." But in April 1645 his churchwardens handed up a present
2 CONC ment against him to the county court "for not reading the booke of Com
2 CONC mon Prayer, and for not adminstring the Sacraments of Baptisme ... and
2 CONC  for not Catechising on Sunnedays in the afternoon."  In brief, they c
2 CONC harged their Church of England priest with being a Presbyterian!  Sir
2 CONC William and the Council expelled him from his parish.
2 CONT
2 CONC There was a substitute minister in Lower Norfolk for awhile rotating b
2 CONC etween the church and the chapel, but apparently he was elderly and /
2 CONC or in ill health. On the Sunday when he was at the church, there were
2 CONC dark doings at the chapel, where "much people (men,women and children)
2 CONC  assembled and mett together," and one  William Durand not only read t
2 CONC o them but also preached.  One Sunday morning in May 1648, the High Sh
2 CONC eriff and two vestrymen went there and broke it up and took Durand int
2 CONC o custody - despite the efforts of three men, one of them a vestryman
2 CONC himself, to rescue him.
2 CONT
2 CONC Friends and neighbors were constantly being hauled into court for"not
2 CONC coming to Church, and obstinately refusing to heare Common Prayer," bu
2 CONC t Richard himself showed a steady talent for not making waves.  In Dec
2 CONC ember 1654, however, he was one of a 24-man grand jury that handed up
2 CONC the following presentment: "Wee of the Grand Inquest, after due Inquir
2 CONC ie made, doe present unto the Court the general breach of the Sabboth
2 CONC day throughout  the whole County, which we conceive is most chiefly oc
2 CONC casioned throuth want of a Godley minister amongest Us in the County.
2 CONC  Where fore we humbly pray & desire that some speedy Course may be tak
2 CONC en to procure and able Minister, lett the charge bee what it will." On
2 CONC e source, "Genealogies of Virginia Families," contends this shows Rich
2 CONC ard Hargrave's putitanical leanings.  If so, it shows them very discre
2 CONC etly, with all 24 jurors on the inside leaning out.
2 CONT
2 CONC In all these pious and tedious court minutes we get one very brief but
2 CONC  reassuring glimpse of Mrs. Richard Hargrave hurrying through.  We don
2 CONC 't learn her name, but we are permitted to infer that, like her neighb
2 CONC or Mrs. John Godfrey, she is a competent and reliable young matron of
2 CONC the community.  Both were called upon in a civic crisis, dated 15 Febr
2 CONC uary 1657/58, involving the good name of a elderly member of the court
2 CONC : "Whereas Mrs. Ann Greene is ajudged to bee very Forward with Child a
2 CONC nd it is reported that she lays the child to Mr. Bartho Hoskins, upon
2 CONC the petition of the sd. Hoskins it is ordered that Mrs. Godfrey and Mr
2 CONC s. Hargrave bring her to Bed & also bee Earnest with her to declare on
2 CONC  Oath in her travail who is the father of it or them, so that your pet
2 CONC itioner may bee cleared of the aspertion layd on him, and the parish s
2 CONC aved of an unnecessary Burden, the said Hoskins paying the Court Charg
2 CONC es." Their Worships' good intentions and pious ingenuity came to naugh
2 CONC t.  Either Mrs. Greene was too busy for chitchat in her Moment of Trut
2 CONC h, since the "it or them"proved to be twins, or Goodwives Godfrey and
2 CONC Hargrave were too busy to listen, and poor Squire Hoskins' good name a
2 CONC nd dignity never got cleared.  For whatever it's worth, Mrs. Greene na
2 CONC med one of the babies Willoughby."
2 CONT
2 CONC Compared to all that limelight and excitement, Richard's appearance in
2 CONC  court that same week seemed humdrum and trivial,  Called to the stand
2 CONC  in King vs. Church, Assault & Battery, "the deposicion of Richard Har
2 CONC grave dayth:
2 CONT
2 CONC "That I beeing abord the pherry saw Mr. Beard and Mr. Church walking o
2 CONC n the docke.  Mr. Beard demanded of Mr. Church to deliver him his good
2 CONC s, but Mr. Church answered him, I know no goods you have in this shipp
2 CONC , nor noe I will deliver, unless you bring me a noate under Mr. Lees h
2 CONC and.  Mr. Beard said that is very well.  Mr. Church said you abused th
2 CONC e masters Mate & made the seamen drunk abord.  Mr. Beard answered, Mr.
2 CONC  Church I wonder that you so mutch forgett your selfe.  With that Mr.
2 CONC Church fell on hime & beate him, & tore the sleeve of his Coate, & fur
2 CONC ther I say nott. (Signed) Richard Hargrave" With a torn sleeve to work
2 CONC  with, even a Yorkshireman can go only so far with a story, especially
2 CONC  when he's aware that people would rather hear what his wife has to sa
2 CONC y.
2 CONT
2 CONT RICHARD IN THE COMMUNITY
2 CONT
2 CONC In 1657 Mr. Isaac Davis, "Merchant, of the City of Bristol", was (a) s
2 CONC uing the local ship carpenter, Abraham Elliott, for non-delivery of a
2 CONC sloop Elliott was supposed to be building for him, and (b) being sued
2 CONC by Elliott for non-return of, and/or damages to, a sloop that Elliott
2 CONC had lent him for the meantime.  Davis lost both cases and appealed bot
2 CONC h Equity, but still had use of the loaner. He needed the latter, it se
2 CONC ems, for business travel.  Late that week he executed a general power
2 CONC of attorney to his "loving friend Richard Hargrave of Elizabeth River"
2 CONC  to receive debts and merchandise for him, conduct business "in and ab
2 CONC out the premisses," and hire lawyers if need be. So far as we know, th
2 CONC at was the last ever seen of Mr. Isaac Davis.  The record shows that w
2 CONC hile he was away he was murdered by the indians.
2 CONT
2 CONC Richard petitioned for, and was granted, administration of the estate,
2 CONC   For several months he was quite busy with, and moderately successful
2 CONC  in, numerous routine court actions connected with the Davis estate an
2 CONC d his own affairs.  A number of things in the Davis matter - the term
2 CONC "loving friend, the signature of one Arthur Mosley as a witness, Richa
2 CONC rd's appointment as administrator - tempt one to guess that here were
2 CONC closer ties: that Davis was perhaps Richard's father-in-law, or brothe
2 CONC r-in-law.  But I find nothing to bear it out, and apparently the two m
2 CONC en were simply partners in business.
2 CONT
2 CONC Aside from all that, Richard's day in court was always comfortably hum
2 CONC drum. He sued a neighbor, and was sued by another, having co-purchased
2 CONC  a steer with each.  He served on juried, grand juries, inquests, post
2 CONC -mortem, and estate appraisals.  He was paid the usual bounty for kill
2 CONC ing a wolf.  He was one of two bondsmen for Richard Jr.'s guardianship
2 CONC  of a neighbor's orphans.
2 CONT
2 CONC In May 1662, when his old employer's orphans were of age, the son-and-
2 CONC heir needed formal identification as such, and called on two impeccabl
2 CONC e witnesses. One was the midwife at his birth.  The other: "Richard Ha
2 CONC rgrave, aged about forty and six yeres, sworne and examined saith: Tha
2 CONC t he this deponent was a servant to Mr. Henry Sewell the elder when He
2 CONC nry Sewell the younger was borne, It beinge upon a May day in the morn
2 CONC inge and further saith not." Ten years later, when young Sewell died a
2 CONC nd left his sister as heir, Richard was called on again. His depositio
2 CONC n this time stated that he had been "a servt to Henry Sewell merchant
2 CONC when Ann the now wife of Col. Lemuel Mason was in her minorrity, and t
2 CONC hat shee was then and still is the reputed daughter of the sd. Mr. Hen
2 CONC ry Saywell, and further sayth nott."
2 CONT
2 CONC Commonplace though they seem, these two statements from Richard himsel
2 CONC f are the only records we have of his first four years as an American.
2 CONC   The 1662 deposition, which says he was "about"  46, may be our only
2 CONC valuable clue to who he was and where he came from.  But that's anothe
2 CONC r story.
2 CONT
2 CONC In 1676, the year of Bacon's Rebellion, the Virginia Assembly ordered
2 CONC the installment of two civic improvements at every county jail in the
2 CONC colony.  In Lower Norfolk, history saith not who was awarded the contr
2 CONC act for the new whipping post, nor how many pounds of tobacco he was p
2 CONC aid, but the other job went to Richard.  The sheriff was ordered to :
2 CONT
2 CONC "To Goodman Hargrove for a Duckinge Stoole  00300".At that time the "g
2 CONC oodman" was already slowing down, and his place in the community gradu
2 CONC ally being taken over by his two sons Richard and Benjamin.  In 1674 h
2 CONC e had been issued a certificate of four headrights, for having paid th
2 CONC e cost of transporting four persons into the colony, which entitled hi
2 CONC m to 200 acres of land.  Three years later he was back, having somehow
2 CONC  mislaid the certificate, and the clerk was instructed to write him ou
2 CONC t another.
2 CONT
2 CONT His last appearance, at the end of 1683, also seems befuddled.
2 CONT
2 CONC Evidently in compliance withe another new law to broaden the colonial
2 CONC economy, he brought in 28 yards of linen, "butt hath nott yet made out
2 CONC  that it is of his owne Growth." One cannot help inferring that with a
2 CONC dvancing age he had lost some of his native sharpness - or, as they wo
2 CONC uld say in the Old Country, his "Yorkshire".
2 CONT
2 CONT RICHARD IN THE GLOAMING
2 CONT
2 CONC In the autumn of 1686 Richard Hargrave Sr. was an old man of 72. His w
2 CONC ife, I think, had died, and his four children were married, and he had
2 CONC  gone to live with one of them.  Richard Jr. had a wife and a family o
2 CONC f at least three. Benjamin had married twice, substantial widows both
2 CONC times.  Margaret was the wife of Samuel Roberts, a thriving farmer of
2 CONC the county.  His pet, his daughter Ann, was married to Arthur Moseley,
2 CONC  whose family was considered gentry and was so Puritan that, like the
2 CONC Massachusetts Pilgrims, they had migrated here by way of Holland.  The
2 CONC y seem to have been in the jewelry business there, and they had a coat
2 CONC  of arms and a houseful of grim-faced family portraits, and all of thi
2 CONC s was impressive to Richard.  Though Arthur was only a second son and
2 CONC therefore not really a "gent.," he was still Mr. Arthur Moseley, parti
2 CONC cularly in the heart of Goodman Hargrave.
2 CONT
2 CONC There had been friction between Richard and Richard Jr., who was compa
2 CONC ratively headstrong, stubborn, argumentative and abrasive.  Even worse
2 CONC , in a period when it had become permissible and almost respectable to
2 CONC  be an outright Bible-reading Protestant, Richard Jr. had shocked his
2 CONC old father by joining what Sir William Berkley used to call "this most
2 CONC  pestilent sect of the Quakers."  As far back as Summer 1678, Richard
2 CONC Sr. had signed all his land over to Ben, who was not a troublemaker, a
2 CONC nd gone to live with the Moseleys.  Ben, to his credit, immediately ga
2 CONC ve the original 150 acres to Richard Jr.  In 1682 Richard Jr. had been
2 CONC  brought into court for failure to have one of his children baptized,
2 CONC and, in his typical bizarre and outrageous Quaker fashion, refused the
2 CONC  Court's order to do so now!  Six months later he posted his name at t
2 CONC he courthouse door, "signifiing his intent to depart the Country," and
2 CONC  subsquently moved up the James River to Surry County.
2 CONT
2 CONC On 21 November 1686, Richard Hargrave Sr. made his last will and testa
2 CONC ment. In unflinchingly Puritan prose, he bequeathed his soul "to Almig
2 CONC hty God my Creator and Redeemer, Who first gave me being and life, and
2 CONC  by whom I expect a glorious resurrection at the Last Day."
2 CONT
2 CONC To Richard Jr. he left a breeding sow. To Benjamin, one broadaxe and a
2 CONC  pruning axe.  To Margaret went his treasured sermon book, "An Abridge
2 CONC ment of Dr. Preston's Works", London, 1648. (John Preston, 1587-1628,
2 CONC was a staunch Calvinist whose sermons and writings had been enormously
2 CONC  popular when Richard was a boy in the West Riding.) Except for these
2 CONC "three above small legacies," the rest of his personal estate was left
2 CONC  to the Moseley's.  Some time in December, Richard Hargrave died, a ve
2 CONC ry long way from where he had started.

2 CONC isham ball_edited-2Some Southern Balls by Donna Rachal Mills is a wond

2 CONC ublished a subsequent study proposing that the Ball immigrant ancestor
2 CONC  is Henry Ball, who immigrated to Virginia prior to 1661 from the Lond
2 CONC on parishes of St. Bride, Fleet Street, and St. Andrew, Holborn. You c
2 CONC an read the study online here. Curiously, this is my favorite area of
2 CONC London – I visit it every trip.

2 CONC George Washington’s mother was a Ball and many family historians (an
2 CONC d residents of Ballsville) try to connect the two Ball families. Ms. M
2 CONC ills definitively asserts there is no evidence to support a familial c
2 CONC onnection, so please don’t claim George Washington as a member of th
2 CONC e family!
2 CONT
2 CONC Isham married Sally Hendrick, daughter of John Hendrick and Judith Wom
2 CONC ack, in Chesterfield County on August 13, 1798. John Hendrick ran an o
2 CONC rdinary in nearby Cumberland County, so it is not surprising that Isha
2 CONC m was operating the Ball Tavern in Powhatan County by 1810. Soon he wa
2 CONC s the owner of 760 acres near Ballsville in Powhatan County.
2 CONT
2 CONC Isham and Sally had four daughters, including my 3rd great-grandmother
2 CONC , Martha, wife of Richard A. Taylor. Sally died about 1808 and Isham n
2 CONC ext married Jane Morris with whom he had three more daughters.
2 CONT
2 CONC He must have been well-regarded in the community because his name can
2 CONC be found often in Powhatan County public records where he was appointe
2 CONC d as a road surveyor, tavern keeper, jury member and more. I was delig
2 CONC hted to see that Isham Ball served as a school board member, as I was
2 CONC a school board member for nine years. He was also the first postmaster
2 CONC  of Powhatan County.
2 CONT
2 CONC The Religious Herald published Isham Ball’s obituary on October 25,
2 CONC 1860. I located a copy at the Virginia Baptist Historical Society at t
2 CONC he University of Richmond. I’ve added paragraphs for reading ease.
2 CONT
2 CONC “Died, in his 82nd year, at his residence, in Powhatan, on the 12th
2 CONC of September, 1860, Mr. Isham Ball. In many respects, the subject of t
2 CONC his notice was a remarkable man, and a remarkable Christian. From his
2 CONC temperament he could never be or do anything by halves.
2 CONT
2 CONC Until past the middle of his life, he was a confirmed infidel. The cir
2 CONC cumstances of his conversion are deeply interesting. While keeping tav
2 CONC ern at Ballsville, a pious lady, who was traveling, spent a Sabbath wi
2 CONC th him. In searching over the books of the house, for something to rea
2 CONC d, she found an old dusty volume with which she was greatly delighted.
2 CONC  On leaving Monday morning, she obtained from Mr. Ball a reluctant pro
2 CONC mise that he would read the book that had given her such comfort. This
2 CONC  he felt more inclined to do, as he found it was a book that had been
2 CONC left him by his mother. He read it, and the result was that all of his
2 CONC  infidelity was swept away; he was awakened to a sense of sinfulness,
2 CONC and was most happily converted.
2 CONT
2 CONC This book he prized next to his Bible and kept it til his death. The t
2 CONC itle page had been lost and consequently, the name of the author is no
2 CONC t known. It was Mr. Ball’s anxious inquiry of all the ministers to w
2 CONC hom he was in the habit of relating his conversion, to learn the name
2 CONC of the writer who had been the means of his salvation. He never learne
2 CONC d it on earth. He has met and learned the author’s name, before the
2 CONC divine throne on high.
2 CONT
2 CONC This was in the year 1822, when Mr. Ball made a profession of religion
2 CONC  by being baptized into the fellowship of the Grub Hill church, by Eld
2 CONC er E. Baptist. Not long after, he became a member of the Muddy Creek c
2 CONC hurch in Powhatan, of which, till his death, he remained an endeared a
2 CONC nd useful member.
2 CONT
2 CONC In all matters pertaining to the church he was uniform and active. He
2 CONC was just such a church member as to be greatly missed now that he is g
2 CONC one. His leading traits as a Christian, were his strong faith and abid
2 CONC ing happiness. For years he seemed to have attained this assurance. He
2 CONC  was a constant and careful reader of God’s word. Religion was his e
2 CONC very day theme. He was always ready to speak of the things of Christ a
2 CONC nd give a reason for the hope that was in him.
2 CONT
2 CONC He had the pleasure of knowing before his departure, that all of his c
2 CONC hildren and most of his grand children had embraced the Saviour! who w
2 CONC as all his hope and all his desire. A few days before his death, he at
2 CONC tended a meeting at which time two of his grand children were converte
2 CONC d; one whose baptism he witnessed just before his brief sickness; and
2 CONC the other one was baptized just after his funeral was preached. His en
2 CONC d was one of peace.”
