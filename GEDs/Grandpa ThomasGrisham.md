**Thomas Gresham** (1761–1816) was a seminal figure in the early American frontier, recognized as the **first white settler in Lauderdale County, Alabama**, and a veteran of the Revolutionary War who endured the hardships of Valley Forge [1].

### **Revolutionary Service and Valley Forge**
Thomas’s military career began at the exceptionally young age of **15**, when he enlisted in the **Continental Army** in 1776 [1]. He served as a private in Captain Robert Powell’s Company within the **3rd Virginia Regiment**, which was commanded by Colonel Thomas Marshall and Lieutenant Colonel William Heth [1, 2].

His service is most notably marked by his presence at **Valley Forge during the brutal winter of 1777–1778** under the command of General George Washington [1]. While the sources confirm he was discharged on February 14, 1778, records from that time specifically note that he was **in the hospital during his discharge**, underscoring the severe conditions faced by the soldiers during that encampment [1].

### **Westward Migration and Land Grants**
For his military service, Thomas received a **land grant in Kentucky** [1]. His journey west was a multi-decade endeavor characterized by persistence in the face of frontier conflict:
*   **Initial Move:** Around 1800, he set out to claim his Kentucky land but was forced to stop in **Lawrence County, Tennessee**, because the **Indians were so hostile** [1].
*   **Alabama Struggles:** He attempted to move into Alabama before 1814, but was again driven back into Tennessee by Indian resistance [1]. During this era, the U.S. Army was active in removing white settlers from **Doublehead's Reserve**, though many, like Thomas, eventually returned to rebuild [1].
*   **Final Settlement:** In 1816, he finally established a permanent home in Alabama after being granted **160 acres of land by Congress** [1]. This homestead was located along **Blue Water Creek**, situated between the modern-day communities of Green Hill and Lexington [1].

### **Cherokee Relations and the Doublehead Petition**
Thomas lived during a volatile period of Cherokee resistance. While the sources focus on the **Doublehead Reserve**, Thomas was a significant participant in the political struggles of the era [1]. He was a **signer of the Doublehead petition** in December 1810, which was a formal protest sent to Washington D.C. by white settlers who were being removed from Indian lands [1]. His residence in 1811 was officially recorded as being on "Indian Land" within the Alabama Territory [1].

### **Family History and Legacy**
Thomas was the son of **George Gresham** and **Elizabeth Watts** [3]. In 1793, he married **Mary Thornton** in Oglethorpe County, Georgia [4]. They established a large family that became a cornerstone of the North Alabama and Tennessee border regions:
*   **The "Grisham" Variation:** Although born a Gresham, both Thomas and Mary have the surname spelled **"Grisham"** on their headstones [1]. Family history notes that many rebels during the Revolution changed their spelling to **distinguish themselves from Loyalist (Tory) relatives** [1].
*   **Children:** They had ten children: John, George, Thomas Jr., Philemon, Jarred, Benjamin C., James, Elizabeth, William B., and Katherine [1].
*   **Genealogical Connections:** Thomas is a direct ancestor of the **England family** line [5, 6]. His great-granddaughter, **Mollie Leona Gresham** (1874–1953), married William Archabald Parish, eventually linking this lineage to the modern England and McDonald families of Lauderdale County [5, 7, 8].

Thomas Gresham died in 1816 and is buried alongside his wife in the **Gresham Cemetery** on Blue Water Creek near Green Hill, Alabama [1, 2].

**Analogy for Thomas Gresham’s Life:**
Thomas Gresham was the **keystone of a frontier arch**; despite being weathered by the freezing winters of Valley Forge and the heat of territorial conflict, he remained the structural point upon which his family successfully transitioned from the colonies of Virginia to the heart of the Deep South.
