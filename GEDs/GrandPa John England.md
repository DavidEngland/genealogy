== Biography ==

'''John England''' (c. 1788–1859) was an early American settler who migrated from South Carolina through Georgia and Tennessee during the formative decades of the young United States. He was a prominent figure in '''Bedford County, Tennessee''', where he established his family and became involved in local land transactions and community affairs.

=== Early Life and Origins ===

John England was born circa 1788 in '''South Carolina''', according to census records. Details of his early life remain sparse, though his later prominence in Bedford County suggests he came from a family of some standing. His early adulthood coincided with the period of rapid settlement in the frontier regions of the upper South.

=== Marriage and Family ===

In '''1810''', in '''Georgia''', John married '''Elizabeth Roberts''' (b. July 26, 1792, South Carolina). Elizabeth was the daughter of '''John Roberts''' (1765–1861) and '''Sarah Smith''' (1774–1860), both of South Carolina. This marriage connected John to the Roberts and Smith families, who were themselves prominent in the settlement of the Tennessee frontier.

=== Settlement in Tennessee ===

By '''1820''', John had relocated to '''Bedford County, Tennessee''', where he appears in the federal census of that year. He remained in Bedford County for the remainder of his life, establishing himself as a landowner and participant in the community's affairs.

Throughout the 1820s, John was involved in significant land transactions in Bedford County. On '''29 August 1821''', he served as a witness to a major deed transfer involving the settlement of John Smith, Jr.'s estate. The deed, recorded in Bedford County Deed Book "0" (1821–1822), page 37, documents the transfer of '''100 acres''' on Sinking Creek from multiple heirs—including Lewis Medlin and Rachel Medlin (formerly Rachel Smith), Robert Medlin and Mary Medlin (formerly Mary Smith), John Roberts and Sarah Roberts (formerly Sarah Smith), and Ruthy Brown (formerly Ruthy Smith)—to Resen Smith. This transaction reveals John England's connections to the Smith family network and suggests his standing in the community as a trusted witness to important legal proceedings.

=== Children ===

John and Elizabeth had '''at least seven children''':

* '''Rasin England''' (b. c. 1823, Tennessee)
* '''Mary England''' (b. c. 1830, Tennessee)
* '''Eliza Jane England''' (b. c. 1834, Tennessee)
* '''John England''' (b. c. 1837, Tennessee)
* '''Jonathan England''' – Married '''Elizabeth Harper'''; their children appear to have been placed with extended family after the couple’s disappearance/death.
* '''William England''' – Possibly the son placed with '''Tilman''' (kin) and moved to '''Lauderdale County, Alabama''' in the 1830s; later a hunter and farmer. Married '''Kitty (Catherine) MacDonald''' of Wartrace; the couple relocated to Alabama or to '''Wayland Springs, Tennessee''' near the state line.

According to the '''1850 Census''', John and Elizabeth lived in '''Bedford County, Tennessee''' with four children still in the household, ranging in age from 13 to 27.

=== Later Life and Death ===

John England died in '''1859''', at approximately 71 years of age. While the exact location of his death is uncertain, available evidence suggests he died in either '''Bedford County, Tennessee''' or possibly '''Perry County, Alabama'''. He would have lived through one of the most transformative periods in American history, including the early republic, westward expansion, and the eve of the Civil War.

His wife Elizabeth survived him and was living in Tennessee at the time of or shortly after his death.
