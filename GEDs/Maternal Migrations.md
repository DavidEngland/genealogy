The migration patterns you've observed are strongly supported by the family histories in the sources, particularly the movement between **Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, and Tennessee**. The families of **Ruth Whitley Lewis**, **Valentine Hargrove**, and **Dempsey White** are central to this interconnected frontier narrative.

### **Ruth Whitley Lewis and the Hargrove Migration**
The sources confirm your observation regarding the migration of **Ruth Whitley Lewis** (c. 1780–1840) and her husband, **Valentine Hargrove** [1].
*   **Kentucky Origins:** Ruth was born in **Lincoln, Kentucky**, the daughter of the skilled brickmason and militia leader **Joseph Francis Lewis** and **Sarah Whitley** [1, 2]. She married Valentine Hargrove on October 9, 1799, in Lincoln [2, 3].
*   **Movement to Tennessee:** Records indicate that while Ruth was born and married in Kentucky, she passed away in **Hardin County, Tennessee**, before 1840 [1].
*   **The Hargrove Lineage:** Her children, including **James Monroe Hargrove** (1818–1884), continued the family’s presence in the Tennessee and Alabama border regions [3, 4]. James Monroe's daughter, **Lydia Serena Hargrove**, was born in **Hardin County, Tennessee**, in 1854 [5].

### **Dempsey White and Land Stewardship**
The family tree of **David England** identifies **Dempsey E. White** (born before 1798, died c. 1862) as a significant ancestor [4].
*   **Farming Legacy:** Your note about buying farms and turning them over to sons aligns with the broader family tradition of **careful stewardship of land and resources** [6].
*   **Kentucky to Tennessee Link:** Dempsey’s son, **James Ervin White**, was born in **Kentucky** in 1838 but eventually died in 1897 after marrying **Lydia Serena Hargrove** of Hardin County, Tennessee [5]. This confirms the **Kentucky to Tennessee** migration path for the White family as well.

### **Broader Regional Migration (VA -> KY -> AL -> TN)**
The sources describe a recurring pattern of movement among these families, often driven by **economic cycles and land availability**:
*   **The Virginia Roots:** Many of these lines, including the **Lewis and Gresham** families, originated in **Virginia** before moving into the "dark and bloody ground" of the **Kentucky** frontier [7-9].
*   **The Alabama-Tennessee Loop:** The **McDonald** family followed a similar path, moving from **South Carolina** into **Tennessee** (Bedford and Lawrence Counties), then to **Lauderdale County, Alabama**, in 1834, and often returning to Tennessee during economic shifts [10-12]. For instance, **John McDonald** sold his 240-acre Alabama farm in 1854 to return to **Wayland Springs, Tennessee** [13].
*   **Land Speculation:** Westward movement was typical for frontier families seeking new opportunities as land prices increased in settled areas [14].

### **The Role of Railroads and Speculation**
Your mention of **"riding trains"** is reflected in the sources both as a means of migration and as a recurring theme in family history:
*   **Rail Migration:** In 1918, **Jahue Scruggs McDonald** (a relative of the Englands) "leased a **railroad car** and moved his family, furniture, and all, by rail" to Oklahoma following a bad crop year in Texas [15].
*   **Tragic Intersections:** The transition to the railroad era was also marked by tragedy; three of John Scruggs McDonald’s children died in accidents involving **trains or trestles** in Alabama and Tennessee [16].
*   **Investment:** Earlier ancestors, like the **Emory/Embry** brothers, were early **investors in railroads** intended to link iron ore mines in Tennessee to Florence, Alabama [17, 18].

**Analogy for this Migration:**
Your ancestors moved across the South like **seeds carried by a prevailing wind**; while they were rooted in the soil of Virginia and Kentucky, the "winds" of land speculation and the emerging speed of the railroad eventually carried them into the fertile fields of Alabama and Tennessee.
