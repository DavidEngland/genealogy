The sources confirm that several members of the **Gresham** family married into the **Thornton** family, a common practice among early pioneer families to consolidate land and kinship ties.

Specifically, three **Gresham brothers** are identified as having married **Thornton sisters**:

*   **Thomas Gresham** (1761–1816), famously known as the first legal white settler in Lauderdale County, married **Mary Thornton** in 1793 in Oglethorpe County, Georgia. Mary was the daughter of **William and Sarah Thornton**.
*   **George Gresham** (ca. 1764–?), Thomas’s brother, married **Martha Thornton**, who was Mary’s sister.
*   **Benjamin Gresham** (ca. 1766–?) is also recorded in family history and comments as having married a **Thornton daughter**, completing the trio of unions between the two families.

These connections are further verified by legal records from **Wilkes County, Georgia**. In the **1809 estate settlement of William Thornton**, George Gresham represented himself and his brother Thomas (who was "out of state" at the time) as legatees, alongside their brother Benjamin Gresham. These marital bonds were foundational to the group of settlers that eventually pushed from Georgia into **Lawrence County, Tennessee**, and the **Doublehead Reserve** in Alabama.
