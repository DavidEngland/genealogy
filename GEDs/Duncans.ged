2 CONC Shuge's father worked for a gin and he began working part time for the
2 CONC  railroad. During ginning season, Charles could be found working with
2 CONC his father at the gin, according to M.C.Cornwell, another longtime fri

2 CONT
2 CONC By 1925, he began working fulltime for the railroad as a member of the
2 CONC  bridge gang. He spent much of his life traveling from one site to ano
2 CONC ther repairing railroad bridges. His territory spanned from Longview t
2 CONC o Laredo and from Fort Worth to Palestine to Houston. In addition to r
2 CONC epairing bridges, Shuge also was called to work during floods and clea
2 CONC n up the site of train wrecks.
2 CONT
2 CONC In the interview with Shuge recently he said, "Working with the railro
2 CONC ad, I never stayed in one place too long. I'd work six to eight days i
2 CONC n one place and be home for only a couple of days before being called
2 CONC out again."
2 CONT
2 CONC Shuge eventually became a machine operator with the railroad and spent
2 CONC  the rest of his career in that capacity. M.C. said the machine operat
2 CONC or operated almost everything that ran on the rail.
2 CONT
2 CONC His career with the railroad came to end in 1956 when Shuge was diagno
