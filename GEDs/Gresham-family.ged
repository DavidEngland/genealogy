1 NOTE by Stephen Freeman:
2 CONT
2 CONT I have studied the ancestry of James Grisham (b 1837) since 1978.
2 CONT
2 CONT Over the years I have had several theories as to his parentage.
2 CONT
2 CONT Two possibilities:
2 CONT
2 CONC 1. That James (b 1837) was a grandson of John Gresham (b 1780) of Lawr
2 CONC ence Co, TN and Tishomingo Co, MS (James said he was born in Tishoming
2 CONC o Co). This line:   George 1700> Samuel 1743> John 1780.
2 CONT
2 CONC 2. That James (b 1837) was a grandson of Thomas Gresham (b 1761) who m
2 CONC arried Mary Thornton and moved to Lauderdale, AL.
2 CONT This line:   George 1700>  George 1736>  Thomas 1761.
2 CONT
2 CONT I have vacillated as to which family James belonged to.
2 CONT
2 CONT However, recent dna evidence may finally be pointing to an answer.
2 CONT
2 CONC I have taken the FamilyFinder dna test through Ancestry. Here are some
2 CONC  results:
2 CONT
2 CONT Matches with the following surnames in their trees:
2 CONT
2 CONT Gresham 92   Grisham 23   Grissom 33
2 CONT
2 CONC For some of these matches, I was able to identify their Gresham/Grisha
2 CONC m/Grissom ancestry.
2 CONT
2 CONT Matches:
2 CONT
2 CONC A)  George Gresham 1700:  3    George Gresham 1736:  4    Thomas Gresh
2 CONC am 1761:  8
2 CONT
2 CONT B)  Samuel Gresham 1743:  1    John Gresham 1780:  0
2 CONT
2 CONT So in total, matches with the George/Thomas line = 12
2 CONT Matches with the Samuel/ John line = 1
2 CONT
2 CONC This has to mean that it is more likely that James b 1837 comes from t
2 CONC he George/Thomas line.
2 CONT
2 CONC John Gresham born 1780 has numerous descendants. It would stand to rea
2 CONC son that, if I were a descendant,  there would be at least one match t
2 CONC o John among the 148 Gresham matches.
2 CONT
2 CONC Although the above evidence is not dispositive, I now believe it is ve
2 CONC ry likely that James Grisham born 1837 was a grandson of Thomas Gresha
2 CONC m born 1761.

2 CONT
2 CONC '''Julia Esther Gresham Larimore''' (1845–1907) was the first wife o
2 CONC f prominent Church of Christ minister '''Theophilus Brown Larimore'''
2 CONC and a foundational figure in the establishment of the '''Mars Hill'''
2 CONC community in Lauderdale County, Alabama.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Early Life and Ancestry ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Born on '''July 11, 1845''', in Lauderdale County, she was the daughte
2 CONC r of '''[[Gresham-190|Philemon Gresham]]''' and '''[[Files-34|Delilah
2 CONC Files]]'''. Her father was a successful plantation owner and businessm
2 CONC an whose family home, built around 1828, became a central landmark in
2 CONC the '''Mars Hill''' area. Esther was raised in a family deeply rooted
2 CONC in the Shoals' pioneer history, living on the plantation land that wou
2 CONC ld eventually become the campus for the Larimores' educational and spi
2 CONC ritual endeavors.<ref>Family oral history; Gresham plantation records<
2 CONC /ref>
2 CONT
2 CONC She was '''born again''' (converted to Christ) on '''October 21, 1859'
2 CONC '' at age 14.<ref>Tombstone inscription, Gresham Cemetery</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Marriage and the Founding of Mars Hill ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Esther married '''T. B. Larimore''' on '''August 30, 1868'''.<ref>Marr
2 CONC iage records; Larimore family history</ref> In '''1870''', the couple
2 CONC utilized '''twenty-seven acres of land''' that Esther had inherited to
2 CONC  build their spacious 12-room home. They selected a site framed with v
2 CONC irgin oak, elm, and hickory, insisting on heavy sills to "successfully
2 CONC  resist time, as well as tornadoes".<ref>Larimore family history; Mars
2 CONC  Hill property records</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONC This home became the heart of '''Mars Hill Academy''' (later Mars Hill
2 CONC  Bible School), which opened on '''January 1, 1871'''. While T. B. Lar
2 CONC imore was often away for months at a time conducting protracted meetin
2 CONC gs across the United States, Esther remained a constant presence at th
2 CONC e school, which operated for seventeen years under their leadership an
2 CONC d drew students from across the South.<ref>Mars Hill Academy records;
2 CONC Larimore correspondence</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Religious Life and Musical Legacy ===
2 CONT
2 CONC As a member of the '''Church of Christ''', Esther's life was defined b
2 CONC y the early Restoration Movement's commitment to scriptural worship.
2 CONT

2 CONT == Biography ==
2 CONT
2 CONC '''William George Gresham''' was born on '''March 8, 1836''', in '''Ha
2 CONC ywood County, Tennessee''', into the humid, cotton-heavy world of the
2 CONC Deep South. He was the son of [[Gresham-191|Jarred Gresham]] and Mary
2 CONC Ann Whitten. His father had carried the family's pioneering spirit fro
2 CONC m Georgia through Tennessee, establishing roots on the rich, dark soil
2 CONC  of the frontier long before the clouds of war gathered on the horizon
2 CONC .
2 CONT
2 CONT === The Antebellum Years ===
2 CONT
2 CONC In the golden twilight of the Old South, William was raised amidst the
2 CONC  sprawling cotton fields of a Deep South plantation. As a young man, h
2 CONC e was known as a figure of his time and place—a man of the earth and
2 CONC  a farmer's son who understood the weight of the harvest and the compl
2 CONC ex social tapestries of the antebellum wilderness. Before the great co
2 CONC nflict began, he lived according to the mores and contradictions of th
2 CONC e era, a man whose personal conduct reflected the moral complexities o
2 CONC f the plantation South.<ref>Gresham family oral history; Conversation
2 CONC History</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Civil War Service ===
2 CONT
2 CONC The romantic era of the planter ended abruptly with the blast of the b
2 CONC ugle. In '''December 1861''', at '''Second Creek Campground in Tenness
2 CONC ee''', William cast his lot with the Confederacy, enlisting in '''Comp
2 CONC any B of the 9th Tennessee Cavalry'''.<ref>"Confederate Enlistment Rec
2 CONC ords," National Archives; Alabama Archives Military Records</ref> Rath
2 CONC er than serving as a common foot soldier, he served as a '''quartermas
2 CONC ter''', responsible for the vital and demanding task of sustaining the
2 CONC  men who rode through the smoke and fire of the Western Theater.<ref>G

2 CONT
2 CONC The war left him, as it left much of the South, shattered and changed.
2 CONC  In '''spring 1865''', William was '''disabled and discharged at Lexin
2 CONC gton, Alabama'''.<ref>Confederate Discharge Records; Alabama Archives<
2 CONC /ref> The man who had managed the logistics of war returned to a world
2 CONC  that had been fundamentally swept away.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Spiritual Transformation ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Returning to a devastated landscape, William underwent a profound spir
2 CONC itual and personal transformation. He traded the logistics of war for
2 CONC the logic of the Gospel, becoming a prominent '''minister in the Churc
2 CONC h of Christ'''. No longer a man associated with the wilder rumors of h
2 CONC is youth, he became a '''circuit-riding preacher''', traversing '''Lau
2 CONC derdale County''' on horseback to establish the very foundations of fa
2 CONC ith in the Shoals area.<ref>Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresha
2 CONC m'', 1976-1977; Conversation History</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONC This transformation was both spiritual and personal. In '''1865''', as
2 CONC  he began his new life in ministry, William married '''Mary Ann Whitte
2 CONC n'''. After her death, he married '''Evaline Lovelace''' on '''18 July
2 CONC  1880'''.<ref>"Alabama, Marriages, 1816-1957," database, FamilySearch<
2 CONC /ref>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Later Life and Legacy ===
2 CONT
2 CONC By the time of his death in '''1923''', the man once known for the rev
2 CONC elries of the plantation had become a venerable patriarch of the Churc
2 CONC h of Christ, deeply respected throughout the Lauderdale County communi
2 CONC ty. He was buried in the soil of the Alabama borderlands he had helped
2 CONC  to settle and sanctify, his legacy transformed from that of a Confede
2 CONC rate quartermaster to that of a faithful minister who spent decades bu

2 CONT
2 CONC '''Nancy Pearl Parish England''' (November 18, 1890 – August 17, 196
2 CONC 5) was born in '''Lauderdale County, Alabama''', as the eldest daughte
2 CONC r of [[Parish-371|William Archabald Parish, Esq.]] (1861–1957) and [
2 CONC [Gresham-182|Mollie Leona Gresham]] (1874–1953). She grew up among t
2 CONC hree younger sisters—'''Mamie Lee''', '''Bertha May''', and '''Edith
2 CONC  Naoma'''—in a family deeply rooted in the early settlement history
2 CONC of the Shoals region.<ref>"United States Census, 1900," index and imag

2 CONT === Ancestry and Heritage ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Nancy Pearl's lineage reflects the convergence of several influential
2 CONC pioneer families who shaped the cultural and religious landscape of no
2 CONC rthwest Alabama.
2 CONT
2 CONT ==== Paternal Line ====
2 CONT
2 CONC She was the granddaughter of [[Parish-371|Brown Parish]] and [[Parish-
2 CONC 371|Rachael Emily Haddock]]. Rachael is remembered for her generosity
2 CONC and community leadership; she donated the land on which the '''New Hop
2 CONC e Church of Christ''' was established—a congregation that would late
2 CONC r become central to Nancy's own life and legacy.<ref>Gresham, Virgil L
2 CONC . ''A Family Named Gresham'', 1976-1977, pp. 28, 48.</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONT ==== Maternal Line ====
2 CONT
2 CONC Her maternal grandparents were [[Gresham-184|William George Gresham]],
2 CONC  a Confederate veteran and circuit-riding minister in the Church of Ch
2 CONC rist, and [[Whitten-501|Mary Ann Whitten]], whose family produced gene
2 CONC rations of Methodist preachers. Through the Greshams, Nancy descended
2 CONC from [[Gresham-191|Thomas Gresham]], widely regarded as the '''first l
2 CONC egal white settler in Lauderdale County''', a figure intertwined with
2 CONC the earliest frontier history of '''Cypress Creek'''.<ref>Gresham, Vir
2 CONC gil L. ''A Family Named Gresham'', 1976-1977.</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONC This dual heritage—the Parish tradition of stewardship and the Gresh
2 CONC am tradition of spiritual leadership—would profoundly shape Nancy's
2 CONC character and role in her community.

2 CONC On '''December 19, 1908''' (Florence Hearld, 1909), at age 18, Nancy m
2 CONC arried '''[[England-1360|William Edward "Ed" England]]''' (December 17
2 CONC , 1879 – February 29, 1964), son of [[England-1361|William M. "Bill"
2 CONC  England]] and [[McDonald-4057|Palina Altimira "Kitty" McDonald]]. The
2 CONC  ceremony was performed by Rev. J. N. Davidson, likely at the Parish f
2 CONC amily home near Oakland.<ref>"Alabama, Marriages, 1816-1957," index, F
2 CONC amilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/FQM2-6QT : accessed
2 CONC  21 Sep 2013), Wm Edward England and Pearl Parish, 19 Dec 1909.</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONC Ed England was known throughout the Oakland community as a skilled far
2 CONC mer and early conservation-minded land steward. He managed significant
2 CONC  agricultural holdings in the [[Burcham Valley]] and Oakland areas of
2 CONC Lauderdale County, embodying the same careful stewardship of land and
2 CONC resources that characterized his mother's family, the McDonalds.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Children and Family Life ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Together, Nancy and Ed raised five children, each carrying forward a d
2 CONC ifferent thread of the England-Parish heritage:
2 CONT
2 CONT 1. '''Bruner Elvin England''' (1911–1948)
2 CONT    * Lost to an automobile accident in his prime
2 CONT    * His early death deeply affected the family
2 CONT
2 CONT 2. '''William Berlin England''' (1913–1990s)
2 CONT    * A lifelong farmer in the Burcham Valley area
2 CONT    * Continued his father's agricultural traditions
2 CONT
2 CONT 3. '''Lois Marveline England''' (1914–?)
2 CONT    * A librarian and educator whose career spanned Florence and Miami
2 CONC    * Documented extensive family history that survives in the England
2 CONC genealogical records<ref>Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresham''
2 CONC , 1976-1977; notes acknowledgment of Lois Marveline England Henderson'
2 CONC s contributions to family history preservation.</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONT 4. '''Otti Louise England''' (1916–1975)
2 CONT    * Married into the Fowler family
2 CONC    * Maintained connections to the Oakland community throughout her li
2 CONC fe
2 CONT
2 CONT 5. '''Lora Mae England''' (1917–?)
2 CONT    * Continued the family line into the mid-20th century
2 CONT
2 CONC Nancy Pearl's role as mother and household manager was vital during th
2 CONC e transformative early decades of the 20th century. The family lived t
2 CONC hrough the Great Depression and witnessed the mechanization of agricul
2 CONC ture, railroad expansion, and the transformation of rural Alabama from
2 CONC  a frontier society to a modern one. Yet throughout these changes, Nan
2 CONC cy maintained the values of faith, hard work, and family loyalty that
2 CONC had characterized her ancestors.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Life as a Farmer's Wife and Community Member ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Nancy Pearl and Ed established their home in the '''Oakland''' area of
2 CONC  Lauderdale County, where they became respected members of the communi
2 CONC ty. As the wife of a prominent farmer and conservationist, Nancy playe
2 CONC d a vital role in managing the household while supporting Ed's agricul
2 CONC tural operations and their family's involvement in the '''New Hope Chu
2 CONC rch of Christ'''—the very congregation her great-grandmother Rachael
2 CONC  Haddock had helped establish decades earlier.
2 CONT
2 CONC The couple's home was known for its hospitality, and Nancy was remembe
2 CONC red by family members for her strength, dedication, and her ability to
2 CONC  bridge the different threads of her heritage—the Parish tradition o
2 CONC f service and the Gresham tradition of spiritual conviction.
2 CONT
2 CONT ==== Agricultural Knowledge and the Three Sisters ====
2 CONT
2 CONC Nancy Pearl maintained extensive knowledge of traditional and sustaina
2 CONC ble agricultural practices that she passed down to younger generations
2 CONC . Most notably, she taught the '''Three Sisters''' planting method—a
2 CONC n ancient intercropping technique known to Native American peoples—t
2 CONC o family members including her great-grandchildren.
2 CONT
2 CONC The Three Sisters technique involved companion planting three compleme
2 CONC ntary crops:
2 CONT * '''Corn''' as the primary structural support
2 CONC * '''Beans''' planted at the base to climb the corn stalks and fix nit
2 CONC rogen in the soil
2 CONC * '''Pumpkins or squash''' planted around the base to shade the soil,
2 CONC retain moisture, and deter pests
2 CONT
2 CONC This knowledge represented a continuity of frontier agricultural wisdo
2 CONC m—techniques that had sustained families through generations of sett
2 CONC lement in Tennessee and Alabama. Nancy's teaching of these methods to
2 CONC younger generations ensured the preservation of sustainable land stewa
2 CONC rdship practices that reflected the values of her pioneer ancestors.
2 CONT
2 CONT ==== Farm Operations and Retirement ====
2 CONT
2 CONC Throughout the mid-20th century, Nancy and Ed operated a productive fa
2 CONC rm in the Oakland area, selling eggs and other agricultural products a
2 CONC t local farmer's markets. Their operation included '''two chicken hous
2 CONC es''' behind their residence, which provided a steady supply of eggs�
2 CONC �their primary market commodity.
2 CONT
2 CONC In their later years, Nancy and Ed retired from active farmer's market
2 CONC  participation, though the couple continued to maintain their gardens
2 CONC and small-scale agricultural operations. Their knowledge and experienc
2 CONC e in both conventional and traditional farming methods made them respe
2 CONC cted figures in the agricultural community of Lauderdale County.

2 CONT === Death and Legacy ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Nancy Pearl Parish England died on '''August 17, 1965''', at age 74, a
2 CONC nd was laid to rest beside her husband at the '''New Hope Church of Ch

2 CONC ry records, New Hope Church of Christ, Lauderdale County, Alabama.</re
2 CONC f> Her grave lies in the same sacred ground where her ancestors had wo
2 CONC rshiped for over a century.
2 CONT
2 CONC Her life forms a vital genealogical bridge—connecting the early 19th
2 CONC -century settlers of Cypress Creek, the Parish and Gresham pioneers, a
2 CONC nd the modern generations of the England family. Through her children
2 CONC and grandchildren, Nancy's legacy extended well into the late 20th cen
2 CONC tury, with her descendants becoming educators, farmers, and community
2 CONC leaders throughout the Shoals region and beyond.
2 CONT
2 CONC Nancy Pearl is remembered not only as a genealogical link but as a ref
2 CONC lection of the Shoals itself: frontier resilience, religious devotion,
2 CONC  and the quiet strength of the women who held these communities togeth
2 CONC er through economic transformation, family tragedy, and the passage of
2 CONC  generations.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Family Connections ===
2 CONT
2 CONC Nancy Pearl's immediate family represented the interconnected network
2 CONC of pioneer families in the Shoals area:

2 CONT
2 CONC Bruner was born in 1911. He was the son of [[England-1360|William Engl

2 CONT :::'''John Deere Tractors and Butter Beans'''
2 CONT
2 CONC That is what I think of when I think of my Uncle Bruner (he's on the f
2 CONC ar left in the picture attached to this profile).  He died before I wa
2 CONC s born.  For years I thought he died from a car wreck hitting a mule.
2 CONC  I found out later that there was more to the story.
2 CONT
2 CONC He was a partner in the John Deere place in Florence, AL.  I'd think o
2 CONC f him when a tractor would break down and get to wanting a new one.  H
2 CONC e was married twice with no issue.
2 CONT
2 CONC My [[England-1358|Dad]] told me that he loved butter beans.  His mothe
2 CONC r, my great [[Parish-370|Grandma Pearl]] would shell and fix a batch.
2 CONC  After the meal, if there was any left, he'd take out a helping and ea
2 CONC t them.  He'd keep doing that till they were all gone.  He wouldn't ju
2 CONC st put them all on the plate  at once.  A helping at a time till they
2 CONC were all gone.
2 CONT
2 CONC I asked my [[England-1359|Grandpa Berlin]] and perhaps my [[England-13
2 CONC 58|Dad]] also how Uncle Bruner died.  I might have said, "He died in a
2 CONC  wreck after hitting a mule".  They told me that the mule wreck (he wa
2 CONC s driving a car) just broke his leg.  The leg didn't set straight and
2 CONC the doctor wanted to re-break and re-set it, which he did.  A blood cl
2 CONC ot formed and went to his brain.
2 CONT
2 CONC My great [[England-1360|Grandpa Ed]] is supposed to have said, "''That
2 CONC  doctor killed my boy''".
2 CONT
2 CONC I cherish the memories I have of [[England-1360|Grandpa Ed]] and [[Par
2 CONC ish-370|Grandma Pearl]].  I wish that I had grown up knowing my Uncle
2 CONC Bruner.  Perhaps we'd had a bigger farm with a fleet of John Deere tra
2 CONC ctors like you see in ''The Progressive Farmer'' magazine.  I can't ea
2 CONC t butter beans without thinking about him.  I've been craving butter b
2 CONC eans, haven't had any garden fresh butter beans in a long time.  I'd e
2 CONC at them all, but not all at once.
