== Research Notes ==The profile for [[Southern-30|William Southern]] had, for several years, a profile attached for a son Henry. There is no documentation to prove Henry's existence.  The combined birth date and birth location ofHenry (1603, Lynhaven River, Lower Norfolk, Virginia) is impossible. The earliest settlement in Jamestown was in 1607. Norfolk, Lower Norfolk and Upper Norfolk did not exist prior to 1636. A search of genealogywebsites, early colonial records, etc., turns up no mention of a Henry Southern in Virginia Colony prior to 1675. I suggest this person never existed. ([[Strutton-11|Strutton-11]] 15:16, 17 April 2021 (UTC)) Side note: Henry's profile was created in 2011. Since then 6 WikiTree members have adopted and then orphaned it and none of them made any changes or added any information. And I don't blame them; no informationfor Henry exists. ''Henry's profile was merged with "brother" John's on 21 April 2021.''

John was born about 1610. He passed away about 1695.
