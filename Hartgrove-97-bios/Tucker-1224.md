== Biography ==A previous version of this profile, citing a Rootsweb discussion grouppost that cited an unnamed book (see Research Notes below), claimed that Memory was daughter of [[Tucker-301|William Tucker]] and [[Thompson-1047|Mary Thompson]].  However, William Tucker made his will while Memory was still living; the will specifically references "my three children" and names them. Memory was not included in the list.<ref>Colonial Virginians and Their Maryland Relatives [database on-line]; [https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/48239/images/VAMDRelatives-010475-12?ssrc=&backlabel=Return&clickref=1011lj7ySzBx%2C1011lj7ySzBx&adref=&o_xid=01011l4xx5&o_lid=01011l4xx5&o_sch=Affiliate%2BExternal p17] (link for Ancestry.com subscribers)</ref>

Therefore, these parents have been detached.

== Research Notes ==*I [who?] copied this information off of Rootsweb, someone's post. However they stated they did not  know the name of the book as someone had photo copies of parts of the book.*[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SOUTHERN/1999-12/0944731656 RootsWeb post] However it does give names of churches, dates andplaces which could be credible.
