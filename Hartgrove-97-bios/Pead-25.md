He married Mary, speculated "Bray"<ref name="gilstrap"/> abt 1647 andbefore 1652 somewhere along the James River (Surry / York Co/s)  as heappears to have brought her over to Lower Norfolk Co according to anapparent immigration notation of "Pead, Mary, 1652, by John Pead, Co."<ref>George Cabell Greer, Clerk of VA State Land office  in "Early Virginia Immigrants, 1623 -1666", Richmond 1913.

Page 253 and a "Pead, Robert, 1651, by Joseph Croshaw, Yorke".  The later might suggest John Pead may have brought his wife, Mary and John Matley from York Co. as well.
