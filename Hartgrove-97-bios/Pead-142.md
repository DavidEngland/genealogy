=== Jordan's Journey ===The owner of Jordan's Journey, Samuel Jordan, died in 1623, so Pead found himself working for a woman, the widow Ciseley Jordan. By 1624/25,when a detailed census was taken, Jordan's Journey was held by Captain William Farrar and Mrs. Jordan, who married in 1625. Their muster shows that Jordan's Journey was a stronghold, with ten servant/soldiers,one of whom was John Pead, and ample provisions: <ref name=coldham/><ref name="muster">Jester, Annie Lash., Hiden, Martha Woodruff. 1883.
