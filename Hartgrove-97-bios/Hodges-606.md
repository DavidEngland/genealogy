== Research Notes =="John Hodge, (16?? - 1679) - [2nd husband of [[Unknown-322865|Margaret(Unknown) Hunnicutt]].]John Hodge is the only known ancestor in this lineage. I have found noinformation to help estimate a birth year. The first record for JohnHodge is the 18 JAN 1677/78 court record naming his wife, Margaret Hodge as the relict (widow) of John Cooper of Surry County, Virginia. John Hodge then wrote his own will on 17 MAY 1679 and it was probated on1 JUL 1679 in Surry County.
