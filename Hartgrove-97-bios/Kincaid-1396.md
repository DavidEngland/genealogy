== Biography ==
Louise was born about 1577.

== Research Notes ==A search of ancestry.com, geni.com and other genealogy websites yieldsno sources or documentation for the existence of Louise Kincaid or her supposed marriage to [[Southern-30|William Southern]]. An internet search using both Google and Bing search engines results in a Find A Grave Memorial with no sources and an erroneous death date and place inJamestown, James City County, Virginia. Since her supposed husband, William Southern, apparently never went to the Virginia colony, it is assumed his wife did not either.
