{{South Carolina Sticker|born in South Carolina}} 

'''James A. Lawson''' is identified in local histories as a large landowner in Wayne County, Tennessee, with holdings on Bear Creek of Weatherford’s Fork. A 1906 county-history installment reports that multiple early farms in the Bear Creek area passed to James A. Lawson, and that his sons occupied farms purchased by their father.<ref>Sixth Installment, published in ''The Clifton Mirror'' 16 February 1906.</ref> He was born on 23 July 1807 in South Carolina, lived in Wayne, Tennessee, United States for about 10 years, was in McNairy, Tennessee, United States in 1870, and died on 15 July 1882 in Houston, Tennessee, United States.

James A. Lawson married '''[[Martin-14317|Mary Ann “Polly” Martin]]'''.<ref name="findagrave_martin">"Find a Grave, database and images", FamilySearch (<https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9392489/mary_ann-lawson> : accessed 4 Feb 2026), memorial page for Mary Ann "Polly" Martin Lawson (Mar 1810–6 Jan 1877), Find a Grave Memorial ID 9392489, citing Lawson Cemetery, Wayne County, Tennessee, USA.</ref> Family tradition describes him as a respected gentleman and a substantial landholder before the Civil War, reportedly controlling large acreage in and around Wayne County and establishing his sons on adjacent farms. These claims require documentation and are summarized in the research notes below.

=== Land and Local Context ===

:The farm adjoining the latter was owned at an early date by Rev. Wm. BAKER, the grandfather of Thos. J. GILLIS, living just across the line in Hardin County. BAKER sold to James A. LAWSON. The farm on the east of this was owned at a very early date by Robert SIMS, the grandfather of Robt. M. SIMS, attorney-at-law, Clifton, and also the grandfather of Thetis SIMS of Linden, the present member of Congress from the 8<sup>th</sup> district. Mr. SIMS had four sons, M. J., Robert, G. W. (father of Thetis), and A. M. (father of your townsman). SIMS sold to James A. LAWSON.

:The farm adjoining the latter on the east was settled by Nathaniel MARIN [editor’s note – surname probably MARTIN], and passed to Wm. SINCLAIR, Sr., and after him to James A. LAWSON.

:Next comes the farm settled by A. J. MARTIN, which remained in the family until about a year ago when it passed to James M. LAWSON, a grandson of James A. LAWSON.

:The next farm was settled by John N. GILLIS and passed to James A. LAWSON. LAWSON was a large land owner. He had four sons, Samuel, G. W., Thos. J., and John M. LAWSON. They are all living but the latter, and occupy the farms purchased by their father. These farms are all on Bear Creek of Weatherford’s Fork.<ref>Sixth Installment, published in ''The Clifton Mirror'' 16 February 1906.</ref>

### Family Tradition (Needs Sources)

* Family accounts describe James A. Lawson as a “fine gentleman” before the Civil War, with large landholdings in Wayne County, Tennessee, and farms established for his sons.
* After the Civil War, family tradition says he changed dramatically, left his legal wife (reported as Mary “Polly” Martin), and relocated to Hickman County, Tennessee.
* These accounts further claim he entered a second relationship in Hickman County, had additional children, and maintained one or more concubines; several descendants carry the Reeves/Reaves surname and appear in DNA matches.
* A family phrase describes him as the “sorry grandfather,” tied to later family tensions and the elopement of relatives in Iuka, Mississippi. These oral-history claims need documentary confirmation.

### Notes from Descendant Research

* According to descendant Douglas B. Lawson (Albuquerque, NM), James A. Lawson abandoned his wife and family in Wayne County following the Civil War, went to Hickman County, remarried (illegally), and raised eight more children. Douglas also stated that James A. Lawson had two sets of illegitimate children by two concubines and a total of about 26 known biological children. See the *James A. Lawson Family History* by Douglas B. Lawson (copy in Wayne County Public Library).
* Family tradition states that James A. Lawson and Sarah Reaves were never married.

### Family Claim

* Family tradition also claims he had at least four sons and five daughters with Sarah Reaves; this needs documentation.

### Research Questions

* Can land and tax records document the reported acreage and farm locations in Wayne County before the Civil War?
* What records connect James A. Lawson to Hickman County (deeds, censuses, court minutes, or church records)?
* Are Reeves/Reaves children named in probate, guardianship, or court records that identify their father?
* Can DNA matches be triangulated with documented Reeves/Reaves lines to verify parentage claims?
* What evidence exists for the reported separation from Mary “Polly” Martin (court records, deeds, or estate files)?
