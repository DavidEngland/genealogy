== Biography ==

Nancy Perkins was born on 1803 in Grayson, Virginia, United States, to '''[[Perkins-1694 | Jabez Perkins Sr.]]''' (b. 1766) and '''[[Creekmore-62 | Nancy Ann (Creekmore) Perkins]]''' (b. 1760). 

'''Research Note:''' The maiden name "Creekmore" for Nancy Ann is uncertain and requires verification through primary sources. Some genealogical records list her as "Nancy Ann Creekmore," but this attribution may be based on secondary sources or family tradition rather than documented evidence. Further research is needed to confirm her parentage and maiden name.

She married '''[[White-14189 | Dempsy E White Sr.]]''' on 24 January 1819, in Whitley, Kentucky, United States. Together they established their household and family, eventually settling in Hardin County, Tennessee by 1849.

According to the 1850 U.S. Census, Nancy was living in the household of her husband, Dempsy White, in Hardin, Tennessee. The census documents her as part of family 63 in Hardin County, indicating she was an established resident and household member during the mid-19th century.

* [[White-14276 | Milton E. White]] (b. 31 March 1824, Kentucky)
