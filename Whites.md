**James Ervin "Ervie" White** (1838–1897) was a prominent figure in the **Hardin County, Tennessee**, and **Lauderdale County, Alabama**, borderlands. Born on **July 8, 1838**, in **Kentucky**, he was the son of **Dempsey E. White** and **Nancy Perkins**. His father, Dempsey, was a pioneer whose origins are recorded in Virginia. Ervie’s maternal heritage was defined by his grandfather, **Jabez Perkins** (1766–1836), a native of **New Haven, Connecticut** (a "Yankee"), who was raised in a notorious **Loyalist (Tory)** household in the North Carolina backcountry. While his father and uncle were well-known Tories during the Revolution, Jabez eventually migrated to **Whitley County, Kentucky**, by 1813, establishing a lineage that would later move further into the Deep South.

### **Migration and Settlement**

The White and Perkins families met in **Whitley County, Kentucky**, where Nancy Perkins married Dempsey White on **January 28, 1819**. This period saw a significant movement of extended families from the Kentucky frontier toward the **Shoals area** and the **Tennessee-Alabama state line**. Ervie eventually settled in **Hardin County, Tennessee**, near his wife’s grandfather, the famed frontiersman **Valentine Hargrove**. His life in the borderlands was tied to the local agricultural economy; he is remembered for raising wheat and processing it at **Gillis Mills**, where he ultimately resided at the time of his death.

### **Family and Marriages**

Ervie White was married twice, a fact that created a broad generational span among his children:

* **First Marriage:** His first wife (name anonymous in these sources) bore him several children, including **William M. White** (b. 1863) and **Dougal Dempsey White** (b. 1865). After Ervie's death, Dougal Dempsey reportedly helped raise his much younger half-sister like a father.
* **Second Marriage:** On **October 1, 1877**, Ervie married **Lydia Serena Hargrove** (1854–1897). This union produced your grandmother, **Myrtle White** (1893–1980), who was one of the youngest children in the family.

### **Extended Kinship**

The White family intermarried with other foundational households in the region, including the **Perkins, Parish, and Lutts** lines. Local census and land records from **Wayne County** note the presence of the **Lutts family**, including **Alexander Lutts** (b. 1823). Family narratives indicate that a female member of the White line married **Dr. Lutts**, further solidifying the family's status within the professional and social "western aristocracy" of the Tennessee Valley. Ervie passed away on **October 3, 1897**, and is interred at **Gillis Mills** in Hardin County.
