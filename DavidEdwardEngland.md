== Biography ==

**David Edward England** is an applied mathematician and atmospheric scientist with specialized expertise in boundary-layer physics, numerical modeling, and the intersection of physical theory with modern machine-learning methods.

=== Early Life & Family ===

David is a descendant of **[[England-1361 | William M "Bill" England]]** (1853–1905) and **[[McDonald-4057 | Palina Altimira "Kitty" McDonald]]** (1859–1936), early settlers and farmers in Lauderdale County, Alabama. Through his paternal line, he connects to the **England** and **[[McDonald-4057 | McDonald]]** families of Tennessee and Alabama, with deep roots in Scots-Celtic genealogy and the **Clan Donald** heritage.

His grandfather, **[[England-1360 | William Edward "Ed" England]]** (1879–1964), was a farmer and conservationist in Oakland, Lauderdale County. The family's tradition of careful stewardship of land and resources—from blacksmithing and gunsmithing to modern conservation—reflects values that have shaped David's scientific approach to understanding natural systems.
