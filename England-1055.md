=== Roberts Family Bible Record ===

The '''Roberts family bible''' serves as a vital primary source confirming John England's marriage to '''Elizabeth Roberts''' and recording their children with variant surname spellings—'''Ingland''', '''Ingold''', and '''England'''—reflecting early 19th-century frontier phonetic recording practices.

The bible entries list children of Elizabeth Roberts and John England:
* '''Sarah Ingold''' (b. 1813)
* '''Malindy Ingland''' (b. 1815)
* '''Jonathan Ingland''' (February 15, 1817)
* '''Tilman Ingland''' (b. 1819)
* '''Martin England''' (b. 1821)
* '''Newel England''' (b. 1826)

'''Jonathan Ingland''' (born February 15, 1817) married '''Elizabeth Harper''' and fathered the orphan '''William England'''. Following Jonathan and Elizabeth's death or disappearance, their children were dispersed among extended kin. It is theorized that the younger William was placed with his uncle '''Tilman Ingland''' during the family's migration to '''Lauderdale County, Alabama''' in the 1830s.<ref>England family records; Conversation History</ref>

These bible entries reflect the broader migration history of the Roberts-England kin group, who moved from the '''Pendleton District of South Carolina''' to '''Bedford County, Tennessee''' around 1810.

=== Deed Record (1821) ===

From DEED BOOK "0" (1821–1822), Page 37 — August 29, 1821. Lewis Medlin, Rachel Medlin (formerly Rachel Smith), Robert Medlin, Mary Medlin (formerly Mary Smith), John Roberts, Sarah Roberts (formerly Sarah Smith), and Ruthy Brown (formerly Ruthy Smith) sold to Resen Smith 100 acres in Bedford County, Tennessee, being on the headwaters of Sinking Creek. The land had been conveyed to John Smith, Jr. by John Smith, Sr. (September 30, 1812). Borders Philip Phillips and Michael Campbell. Registered October 1, 1821. **John England** witnessed this deed, demonstrating his presence and standing in the Bedford County community.

=== Northward Migration and Western Movement ===

Beyond the well-documented southern migration to Alabama and Arkansas, family oral history suggests that some England family branches moved northward during the mid-19th century, potentially connecting with '''Latter-day Saint (LDS/Mormon)''' communities. These descendants may have been part of the broader '''Mormon migration westward''' to Ohio, Missouri, Utah, and other western territories during the period of LDS expansion (1830s–1860s).<ref>Family oral history; Conversation History; England family genealogical theories</ref>

While documentary evidence for this northern branch remains elusive, oral tradition within the family preserves stories of relatives who "went north" and "joined the Mormons," eventually settling in western territories. This pattern would align with broader 19th-century migration trends, wherein frontier families dispersed along multiple routes—some southward to Alabama and Arkansas (as documented with Tilman and Newel), and others northward and then westward. Such movements would explain apparent genealogical gaps and the difficulty in tracing certain England family lines through conventional Tennessee, Alabama, and Arkansas records.<ref>England family genealogical theories; Conversation History</ref>

Further research into LDS genealogical records, Utah territorial records, and northern church migration patterns may help clarify these western branches of the England family.
