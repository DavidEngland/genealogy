== The Story of Wu-te-he ==

In the ancient Cherokee town of **Tasigi** (**ᏔᏍᎩᎩ**), located within the **Cherokee Nation East** (**ᏣᎳᎩᎯ ᎠᏰᎵ**), lived a woman of the **Red Paint Clan** (**Ani-Wodi** / **ᎠᏂᏬᏗ**) named **Wu-te-he** (**ᏭᏖᎯ**). As a member of the **Ani-Wodi**, she was a keeper of the traditions, skilled in gathering the plants of the **earth** (**ᎡᎳᏗ**) and preparing the sacred red paint that symbolized power and success.

== The White Buffalo Prophecy ==

The elders of her time, including the influential leader **Doublehead** (**ᏔᎵᏧᏍᎦ**) and the warrior **Dragging Canoe**, are said to have carried a heavy vision of the **white buffalo** (**ᎤᏁᎬ ᎩᎦᎨ**). The prophecy whispered that **ᎤᏁᎬ ᎩᎦᎨ ᏓᏟᎶᏍᎬᎢ, ᏧᎵᎭᏂᏍᎬᎢ ᏱᎩᏟᏍᏗ**—"The white buffalo moves quietly; thus we learn how to walk". In this vision, the white man's presence grew like a shadow over the land, threatening to take the **earth** (**ᎡᎳᏗ**) through their "talking leaves"—the written papers that the **Cherokee** (**ᎠᏂᏴᏫᏯ**) did not yet possess.

To protect their future and the survival of their people, the leaders sought a strategic path. They speculated that by forming alliances and having sons with white men, these children—born into their mother's clan through the **matrilineal** (**ᎦᏚᎩ**) system—could navigate both worlds and secure **deeded land** that the white man's law would respect.

== Walking in Balance ==

It was in this atmosphere of shifting winds (**ᎤᏃᎴ**) that **Wu-te-he** met **Nathaniel Lawson**, a man from Virginia, around the year 1755. Choosing to **walk in balance** (**ᏙᎯ ᎤᏴᏫ**), she entered into a union that brought forth her son, **Thomas Lawson**. Though Nathaniel eventually passed away in the frontier lands, **Wu-te-he** ensured her children remained rooted in the **Red Paint Clan**, raising them to keep their **hearts clean** (**ᎤᏓᎷᎸᏔᏅ**) and to remember the **ancient fire** (**ᎦᎵᏉᎩ ᎤᏃᏴᏫ**).

== The Mother of Sequoyah ==

Among Wu-te-he's children was her most famous son, **Sequoyah** (**ᏍᏏᏉᏯ**), also known as George Guess. Born into the **Ani-Wodi** clan through his mother's line, Sequoyah would later fulfill the prophetic need for the **Cherokee** to possess their own "talking leaves." Between 1809 and 1821, this brilliant silversmith single-handedly created the **Cherokee syllabary** (**ᏣᎳᎩ ᎦᏬᏂᎯᏍᏗ**), bringing literacy to the Cherokee people within months—one of the most remarkable intellectual achievements in human history.

She also raised **Tahlonteeska** (**ᏔᏠᏖᏍᎧ**) and **Tahnoyanteehee**, ensuring all her sons understood their place within the **Ani-Wodi** clan and their responsibilities as Cherokee men who could bridge two worlds.

== Keeper of the Ancient Ways ==

As a Cherokee woman of influence, Wu-te-he held a position of authority in her community. Cherokee women were not merely caretakers but active leaders, diplomats, and decision-makers. They owned the homes, controlled agricultural production, attended councils, and had decisive voices in matters of war and peace. 

The **Paint Clan's** traditional role in gathering tuckahoe (a wild root plant) and preparing ceremonial paints was essential to Cherokee spiritual life. Red paint symbolized success, triumph, and sacred power. Wu-te-he's knowledge of these traditions made her an important keeper of cultural practices that she passed down through the generations.

== Legacy ==

She remained a pillar of her community until her death around 1814, having provided the cultural foundation for her most famous son, **Sequoyah**, to later give the **Cherokee** people the ability to "talk on paper" through the **syllabary**. Her life story serves as a reminder that **ᎡᎶᎯᎢᏃ ᎦᎸᎳᏗ** (**Elohehino galvladi**)—we are all related.

Wu-te-he's greatest legacy lives on through her son Sequoyah's gift to the Cherokee people. The syllabary he created allowed the Cherokee to preserve their language, culture, and history in written form. Every Cherokee who reads and writes their language today does so because of the genius of her son and the cultural foundation she provided him as a member of the Ani-Wodi clan.

After her death, Sequoyah continued her trading business, eventually moving west and teaching the syllabary to Cherokee communities in Indian Territory (**ᎠᏂᏧᎳᎩ ᎢᏤᎦᎸᏛᎢ**).
