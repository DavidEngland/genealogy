# Help: Categorization

**Categories** are groups of [profiles](/wiki/Help:Profiles) or pages.

For example:

- [Category:Regions](/wiki/Category:Regions)
  - [Category:North America](/wiki/Category:North_America)
    - [Category:United States of America](/wiki/Category:United_States_of_America)
      - [Category:Louisiana](/wiki/Category:Louisiana)
        - [Category:St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana](/wiki/Category:St._Tammany_Parish%2C_Louisiana)
          - [Category:Madisonville, Louisiana](/wiki/Category:Madisonville%2C_Louisiana)

When a profile has a tag such as `[[Category:Madisonville, Louisiana]]` in its [biography](/wiki/Help:Biographies), the profile will appear on the [Category:Madisonville, Louisiana](/wiki/Category:Madisonville%2C_Louisiana) page. Here is more about how and why to categorize profiles.

## Benefits of Categorization

By grouping profiles that share something in common, categories can:

- help members organize ongoing research,
- help those with a special interest find profiles they may want to investigate or collaborate on, and
- help historians or genealogists researching a particular topic or location.

For example, you might be interested in collaborating with other genealogists whose ancestors served in the same military unit as your ancestor. Or someday a young family member might be interested to see all their ancestors who played baseball or worked on trains.

Categories also power our **special [MyConnections](/wiki/Help:MyConnections) feature**. This enables anyone to immediately see their ancestors and relatives in the group. Imagine being in a cemetery and seeing how you are related to everyone buried beneath your feet with one click. Categorization makes this possible.

As of June 2023, we have **[Category Activity Feeds](https://www.wikitree.com/g2g/1590868/did-you-see-the-new-category-activity-feeds)** to enable you to monitor all the edits to profiles in any category.

## How to Categorize a Profile

First, research and write the [biography](/wiki/Help:Biographies). Categories are not a substitute for biographical text and [sources](/wiki/Help:Sources), and once a person's story is written it's easier to know how to categorize them.

While in edit mode, **look for the category icon** on the toolbar above the biography section.

Clicking this icon will open a text box. In this space, begin typing a word that may be in the category name. Existing categories will appear as you type. If you see the one you want, just click it. The category tag will be added to the profile. When you save your changes, the profile will appear on the category page.

Always **select the narrowest applicable category**. That is, choose the most-specific, lowest-level category you can find. For example, put a profile in [Category:Madisonville, Louisiana](/wiki/Category:Madisonville%2C_Louisiana) rather than [Category:Louisiana](/wiki/Category:Louisiana).

To **remove** a profile from a category, simply remove the tag from the profile's text.

## Examples of Ways to Categorize a Profile

Here are some of the ways you can categorize a person:

- **Place** they were born, lived, married, or died, e.g. [Category:Abbotsford, British Columbia](/wiki/Category:Abbotsford%2C_British_Columbia).

- **Cemetery** in which they're buried, e.g. [Category: Hollywood Cemetery, Houston, Texas](/wiki/Category:Hollywood_Cemetery%2C_Houston%2C_Texas).

- **Religious categories** or congregation in which they participated, e.g. [Category: St. Francis Xavier's Church, Madisonville, Louisiana](/wiki/Category:St._Francis_Xavier%27s_Church%2C_Madisonville%2C_Louisiana).

- **Migration** path or ship they sailed on, e.g. [Category:Migrants from Bavaria to New York](/wiki/Category:Migrants_from_Bavaria_to_New_York).

- **School** they attended, e.g. [Category:Armidale High School, Armidale, New South Wales](/wiki/Category:Armidale_High_School%2C_Armidale%2C_New_South_Wales).

- **Occupation**, e.g. [Category:Attorneys](/wiki/Category:Attorneys) or [Category:Tanners](/wiki/Category:Tanners). See [Alphabetical List of Occupations by Name](/wiki/Category:Occupations_by_Name).

- **Business** or **industry** in which they worked, e.g. [Category:Jahncke Shipyard, Madisonville, Louisiana](/wiki/Category:Jahncke_Shipyard%2C_Madisonville%2C_Louisiana).

- **Military** unit, e.g. [Category: 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars](/wiki/Category:8th_King%27s_Royal_Irish_Hussars), battles they participated in, e.g. [Category:Battle of Brandywine Creek](/wiki/Category:Battle_of_Brandywine_Creek), profession in the service, e.g., [Category:B-29 Navigators](/wiki/Category:B-29_Navigators), or honors received, e.g. [Category:King's South Africa Medal](/wiki/Category:King%27s_South_Africa_Medal).

- **Historical event** of which they were a part, e.g. [Category:Antinomian Controversy](/wiki/Category:Antinomian_Controversy) or [Category:Auschwitz - Birkenau Concentration Camp Victims](/wiki/Category:Auschwitz_-_Birkenau_Concentration_Camp_Victims).

- Things that make them historically significant, e.g. [Category:Founders and Settlers of Rhode Island](/wiki/Category:Founders_and_Settlers_of_Rhode_Island).

- **Family event** in which they participated, e.g. [Category:Nathan Baxter and Anna Dodge 1951 Family Reunion](/wiki/Category:Nathan_Baxter_and_Anna_Dodge_1951_Family_Reunion).

- **Organization** in which they were involved, e.g. [Category:Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society](/wiki/Category:Fellows_of_the_Royal_Geographical_Society) or [Category:Gold Star Mothers](/wiki/Category:Gold_Star_Mothers).

- **Maintenance categories** for the genealogy that needs to be done on their profile, e.g. [Category:Unsourced Profiles](/wiki/Category:Unsourced_Profiles) or [Category:Family Brick Walls](/wiki/Category:Family_Brick_Walls).

- **Personal categories** for your ongoing research or categorization that may only be of limited interest, e.g. [Category: Durbin-702 Add Sources](/wiki/Category:Durbin-702_Add_Sources).

**Note:** Profiles can be in multiple categories. This makes them easier to find. However, a profile should never be in more than one category in the same hierarchy.

## Adding New Categories

If you would like to use a category but can't find it by [searching](https://www.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=003048598688029858478:aemrovxydzo) or [browsing](/wiki/Category:Categories), click the "**request a new category or advice**" link that you will see next to the Edit Text box on the edit page of any profile.

Members can [create new categories](/wiki/Help:Category_Creation_and_Removal) if they fit within an existing hierarchy and use our agreed-upon [category naming scheme](/wiki/Help:Category_Names) but if you have any uncertainty, use the link to start a conversation in [G2G](https://www.wikitree.com/g2g/) and you're sure to get help from [Categorization Project](/wiki/Project:Categorization) members and other advanced WikiTreers.
