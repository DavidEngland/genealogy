The union of **Mary Ball** (1749–1813) and **John Washington Hargrove Sr.** (ca. 1750–1838) established a lineage of influential frontier leaders and warriors who were central to the settlement of Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, and the Alabama Shoals. Their children and grandchildren bridged the gap between the "western aristocracy" of the late Colonial period and the development of the industrial frontier.

### **Frontier Warriors and Pioneers**
The sons of Mary Ball and John Washington Hargrove Sr. were characterized as bold defenders of the northwestern and southern frontiers:
*   **Captain William Hargrove (b. 1773):** He was a renowned **Indian fighter** and commander of the **Indiana Rangers** (1st Division), patrolling from the Wabash River to French Lick. He served under William Henry Harrison at the **Battle of Tippecanoe** and was later promoted to **Major** of the 4th Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers during the War of 1812.
*   **Valentine Hargrove (b. 1778):** Named for his maternal grandfather Valentine Ball, he was described as a **"good warrior"** who accompanied his uncle-in-law, Col. William Whitley, to rescue white prisoners from Cherokee towns. During the War of 1812, he served as an **Adjutant** in Burrus' 16th Regiment of the Mississippi Militia in Madison County.
*   **John W. Hargrove Jr. (b. 1775):** He was a prominent civic leader who served as the **Sheriff of Claiborne County, Tennessee**, for sixteen years.
*   **James B. Hartgrove:** He served as a private in **Ewing’s Company** of the Kentucky Militia during the War of 1812.

### **Influential Matriarchs and Female Notable Lines**
The female descendants were essential to the survival and social fabric of the frontier, often linking the Hargrove line to other distinguished families:
*   **Ruth Whitley Lewis:** The wife of Valentine Hargrove, she was the daughter of master brickmason **Joseph Francis Lewis** and Sarah Whitley. Her grandmother was **Winney King**, and her uncle was the legendary **Col. William Whitley**.
*   **Lydia Serena Hargrove (b. 1854):** A granddaughter of Valentine and Ruth Hargrove, her marriage to **James Ervin White** linked the Hargrove warriors to a prosperous family of farmers and magistrates who had farmed in the South since 1747.
*   **Rachael Emily Haddock (1838–1908):** Married William John Brown Parish (the son of William Brown Parish and Elizabeth Louisiana Hargrove); she is celebrated for **donating the land** for the founding of the **New Hope Church of Christ**, a pillar of the local community.
*   **Nancy Pearl Parish England (1890–1965):** A great-granddaughter of the Valentine and Ruth Hargrove line, she served as a **genealogical bridge** to modern generations and was noted for preserving traditional agricultural knowledge, such as the **"Three Sisters"** planting method.

### **Notables and Historic Connections**
