# Valentine Ball - Source Citations

## Research Summary

**Important Note:** Extensive research by Rachel M. Lennon published in leading genealogical journals indicates there is **NO evidence** to tie Valentine Ball to the Ball family of George Washington's mother. "Nor does evidence support a family tradition of kinship to the illustrious Balls from whom George Washington's mother descends, a family rooted in the Corotoman River area of Lancaster County, before 1653, by the merchant and planter Col. William Ball."

## Research Notes

**Regarding Conflicting Records:**
Multiple FamilySearch entries reference church records from Delaware, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, and Rhode Island for the same 1733 marriage. These appear to be indexing errors or duplicate entries in various state collections. The primary and most reliable source is the Virginia marriage record from Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County, where both Susannah's christening and marriage occurred.

**Regarding MyHeritage Entry:**
A MyHeritage Family Trees entry suggests "Susannah Collins (born Lewis)" with different dates (Birth: Aug 23 1712, Death: Apr 16 1768) and different parents (Zachary Lewis and Mary Walker) married to Joseph Robertson Collins. This appears to be a different person entirely and should not be confused with Susannah Lewis Ball.
