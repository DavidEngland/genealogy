The ancestry of your **White and Hargrove** lineages reflects a classic migration of **Scots-Celtic pioneers** from the Revolutionary-era frontiers of Virginia and the Carolinas through the Kentucky wilderness, eventually settling in the volatile **Mississippi Territory** and the **Tennessee-Alabama borderlands**.

### **The White Ancestry and the Perkins Connection**
Your **White family** lineage begins with **John Calvin White Sr.** (born ~1753 or 1768), who was a member of a prosperous farming family in **North Carolina**. He served as a **Magistrate** in **Whitley (formerly Knox) County, Kentucky**, where he possessed Commonwealth law books until his death around 1830. His son, **Dempsey E. White** (1798–1859), was born in **South Carolina** and became a prosperous pioneer and member of the **Kentucky Legislature**.

Dempsey married **Nancy Perkins** in 1819 in Whitley County. Nancy was the daughter of **Jabez Perkins** (1766–1836), a native of **New Haven, Connecticut**, who was famously raised in a **notorious Loyalist (Tory)** household in North Carolina. Jabez migrated to **Grayson County, Virginia**, before moving to the **Knox/Whitley County** area by 1813. This line eventually moved into the Deep South, with family branches settling in **Madison, Marshall, and Wheeler Counties, Alabama** [User Query, 1804].

### **The Hargrove Heritage and the "Good Warrior"**
Your maternal line connects to the **Hargrove** (often recorded as **Hartgrove**) family through your great-grandmother **Lydia Serena Hargrove** (1854–1897), who married **James Ervin "Ervie" White**.
*   **Valentine Hargrove:** Lydia’s grandfather, **Valentine Hargrove** (born ~1778), was a native of **Amherst, Virginia**. He is characterized in the **Draper Manuscripts** as a **"good warrior"** who famously traveled with his uncle-in-law **Colonel William Whitley** to rescue white prisoners from **Cherokee towns**. In his old age, Valentine resided with his son **James Monroe Hargrove** in **Hardin County, Tennessee**.
*   **The Whitley-Lewis Link:** Valentine married **Ruth Whitley Lewis**, the daughter of **Joseph Francis Lewis** and **Sarah Whitley**. Joseph was a skilled **brickmason** from England or Ireland who contributed to the construction of permanent structures on the Kentucky frontier, including the historic **"Sportsman’s Hill"** brick home of his brother-in-law, William Whitley.
*   **Ball Family Connection:** Valentine’s mother was **Mary Ball** (1749–1813), which ties this branch to the prominent **Ball family of Virginia**, the lineage of **George Washington**.

### **Migration to the Mississippi Territory and Madison County**
The migration into the **Mississippi Territory** (which included present-day Alabama) was driven by **"Alabama Fever,"** fueled by high cotton prices and the opening of indigenous lands.
*   **Thomas Gresham:** Your ancestor **Thomas Gresham** is recognized as the **first legal white settler** in **Lauderdale County**, having claimed land along **Blue Water Creek** in 1816 after earlier attempts were driven back by hostile Indians.
*   **Madison County Hub:** Many associated families, including the **Perkinses, Allens, and Whites**, appeared in the **1809 "Squatter Census"** of Madison County before land sales were legalized. Figures like **Colonel Peter Perkins** and **Thomas Freeman** (the government surveyor) were central to organizing this new territory.

### **The Border Lands: Hardin, Wayne, and Lauderdale**
Your families eventually concentrated in the **volatile transition zone** of the **Tennessee-Alabama state line**, a region defined by the **Cypress Creek** watershed and shifting county boundaries.
*   **Ervie White:** Your great-grandfather **James Ervin "Ervie" White** (1838–1897) was born in **Kentucky** but settled in **Hardin County, Tennessee**, where he raised wheat and processed it at **Gillis Mills** [116, 1800, User Query].
*   **The Pigg and Scott Connection:** Your father's line in **Wayne County** (the **Pigg, Scott, and Lawson** families) managed the local legal infrastructure, with **John Martin Scott** serving as a **Magistrate** and **Rial Brewer** as **High Sheriff** [User Query, 1123, 1403, 1408].
*   **Interwoven Roots:** These families intermarried frequently; for instance, **Mary Jane Scott** married **William T. Pigg**, and their daughter **Eliza Ann Pigg** married **George Henry Lawson**.

This **"western aristocracy"**—composed of **McDonald gunsmiths**, **Lewis brickmasons**, and **White wheat farmers**—settled strategic points like **Cromwell Crossroads** and **Gravelly Springs**, providing the craftsmanship and resources that built the **Shoals**.
