<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><b>1.  Jabez Perkins</b>, son of <b>Timothy Perkins</b> and <b>Miriam Sperry</b>, was born on 6 Nov 1766 in New Haven, New Haven Co., CT, died in 1835 in Whitley Co., KY at age 69, and was buried in Whitley Co., KY.
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">General Notes: I find Jabez an interesting ancestor. Born in New Haven, CT, before the American Revolution, he was raised in a Loyalist household in the North Carolina back country. As a child he saw his Father, Timothy, and paternal Uncle, Joseph, join the Loyalist forces against the Americans. According to contemporary accounts, his Father and Uncle were, "notorious Tories" who one time captured Col. Cleveland, an American commander and virtual warlord in the New River settlements. While being held for trial by the Loyalists, Cleveland was able to escape, supposedly with the help of one of the women of the household. The family were early Methodists.<br><br>By 1784 a guardian was appointed for Jabez in Wilkes Co., NC. Normally, one would assume this to mean that his father was dead. However, there is some evidence that Timothy Perkins was alive and living in Grayson Co., VA. Shortly after the guardian was appointed, Jabez appears to have married and moved to Grayson Co., VA, where several of his children were born. In 1789, he was appointed administrator to the estate of his maternal Uncle, William Sperry, in Wilkes Co., NC. It is not yet known if William Sperry was a Loyalist or if he supported the Americans in the Revolution.<br><br>By 1813 he was in the Knox/Whitley Co. KY, area. Sometime after 1830, already 65 years old, he moved his family to the Bureau/Putnam Co. Illinois area. He and his sons purchased land in 1835 and 1836. By December of 1835 he had returned to Whitley Co., KY, where he made his will and died before February 13, 1836. Jabez' son William returned to Whitley Co. and remained there the rest of his life. The rest of Jabez' children remained in Illinois or moved further West.<br><br>Some researchers have identified Jabez' wife as Nancy Ann Creekmore. I am not convinced that this is correct. I am also not convinced that his wife at the time he made his will is the mother of his children. Hopefully, further research in NC or VA will turn up a marriage certificate to settle the question.<br><br>In 1784, George Morris was appointed Guardian to Gebas Perkins (Wilkes Co., NC, Will Bk 1, p.123). In 1784, Wm. Smith was the Administrator of W. Sperry (Wilkes Co., NC Will Bk 1, p. 122). In 1789, Jabish Perkins was administrator of William Sperry, dec'd. (Wilkes Co., NC, Will Bk 1, p. 254). Inventory of the Estate of William Sperry is in Wilkes Co., NC Will Bk 1, p. 262 dated 1789.<br><br>Between 1784 and 1813, Jabez was in Grayson Co. VA, before removing to Knox Co., KY.<br><br>Jabez Perkins received Knox Co. Circuit Court Certificate No. 160 for 200 acres of land on 5 Oct. 1813. This is now called Tellico Grant No. 575. It was surveyed on 24 August 1821 and was in the new county of Whitley on the Gelico River. He paid off his mortgage for the full price of $20.00 to the Commonwealth of Kentucky on 22 January 1828. See, Tellico Grants, No. 575, Book 2, page 1, Land Office, Kentucky Secretary of State.<br><br>Sometime after 1830 Jabez and his family moved to the Bureau/Putnam Co., area of Illinois. Jabez purchased 80 acres of land in Bureau Co., on 13 July 1835 (IL Pub. Dom. Land Tract Sales, Arch. vol. 708, p. 119). Jesse and William also purchased 80 acres of land on the same day in the same township as Jabez. Timothy had purchased two 80 acre tracts in the same township on 20 and 25 June 1835. Jesse purchased additional tracts of 40, 160 and 80 acres on 7 Sept 1835, and 14 Jan 1836.<br><br>Jabez' son Solomon Perkins may have been the Solomon Perkins who purchased land in Adams Co., IL, on 27 June 1818. This was a Military land bounty (IL Pub. Dom. Land Tract Sales, Arch. vol. 808, p. 481).<br><br>    WILL of JABUS PERKINS, of Whitley Co., KY was made 27 Dec 1835, and probated February Term, 1836.

<p style="margin-left:0.5in">Jabez married <b>Nancy Ann Unkn</b> about 1783 in Grayson Co., VA, OR, Ashe Co., NC. Nancy was born in 1766 and died on an unknown date in KY? at age 70.
<p style="margin-left:1in">General Notes: There is the possibility that there were two wives named Nancy.  There is a renunciation of the will dated in Feb 1836 from Nancy Perkins in Whitley Co., KY, Will Book 1.  There is a report of a marriage license for Jabez Perkins and Nancy White dated the same day the will was made.  It is supposed to be in the KY Archives.  This compiler has not seen it.<br><br>There is a Pulaski Co., Ky deed where Nancy Ann Perkins, wife of Jabez Perkins, relinquishes dower in land.<br><br>Family lore is that she was Nancy Ann Creekmore.  No documentation has been found for her surname.<br><br><br></p>
