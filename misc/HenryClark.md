According to legendary accounts of the construction of **Sportsman's Hill** (the William Whitley House), the physical foundations of this historic brick home were laid by your ancestor **Joseph Francis Lewis**, a skilled brickmason. To sustain the labor force during this monumental task—building the first brick house west of the Blue Ridge Mountains—a **German** with the "rather un-German name" of **Henry Clark** is joked to have **furnished the whiskey** for the workmen. Both the mason and the whiskey provider were reportedly **paid in land** for their essential contributions.

This colorful detail fits into the broader social fabric of the **Whitley** family’s life on the Kentucky frontier:

*   **The "Irish Tradition" and Frontier Medicine:** Whiskey was a staple of the era, viewed as a "cure-all" that served as a stimulant, tranquilizer, and disinfectant. William Whitley's parents were **Irish immigrants**, and the hospitality of his home often mirrored these cultural roots.
*   **Horse Racing:** Sportsman's Hill was not just a home but a social hub; by 1788, Whitley had laid out a **race path** on his property. This development was so significant to the community that the county court eventually ordered the construction of a road leading specifically from the **"Whitley race paths"** to the courthouse.
*   **Grand Barbecues:** Whitley was famous for his hospitality, often celebrating military returns with **great barbecues**. Following the Nickajack expedition in 1794, he hosted a massive gathering where the main course consisted of **shoats roasted whole**, each with a potato in its mouth.
*   **A "Western Aristocracy":** These traditions of fine craftsmanship, competitive sport, and lavish hospitality formed the basis of an influential **"western aristocracy"**. This network of families—including the **Whitleys, Lewises, and Hargroves**—carried these traditions from Virginia into Kentucky and eventually southward into the Tennessee Valley.
