      give this space for a thank you to Robert Brewer with whom we have just
      become acquainted.&nbsp; The wealth of knowledge he gave us via the
      computer offers this sharing of his meticulous research and it is very
      much appreciated. In this gentleman I can imagine a look backwards to the

	  The Georgia Trail<br><span class="style12">Research compilation by Rob
	  Brewer</span></p>
	  <p class="style13">This is a working document, so it is not and may never
	  be completely finished or without errors. Most of the information
	  collected has been proven or has come from credible sources. Some of the
	  speculated information is based on families that migrated together or
	  ended up in the same areas. It is a composition of petitions, tax list,
	  censuses and passed down folklore along with historical events of our
	  country. Spellings of names varied on many documents so some have been
	  corrected and some left the way there found. Through DNA testing it has
	  been determined this Brewer line descends from George Brewer and Sarah
	  Lanier.</p>
	  <p class="style14"><font class="style5" size="3"><span class="style1">
	  Wilkes County Georgia is where many of our ancestors migrated to in the
	  late 18</span><sup><span class="style1">th</span></sup><span class="style1">
	  century. Located near Augusta where the first settlement began at Fort
	  Heard sometime after 1720. </span></font></p>
	  <p class="style13">White settlers that had colonies along the Savannah
	  River were kept out of the Little River area by the Indians. In 1763, a
	  treaty was signed between the Colonial governors of Virginia, North
	  Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia and the Indians proclaiming Little
	  River as the boundary between them and the white settlers. But the white
	  men drew the Indians into making trades and building a debt they could not
	  pay. So as concession they offered up the land for their indebtedness even
	  though they were suspicious of the white man. </p>
	  <p class="style14"><span class="style6">In 1773, The Cherokee and Creek
	  Indians relinquished more than two million acres in the upper/middle
	  northern part of Georgia. This was called “The Ceded Lands” which soon
	  would be known as Wilkes County and eventually split off into other
	  counties such as Franklin, Jackson, Clarke, Baldwin, Hancock, Warren and
	  others. Settlers from South Carolina, Virginia and from as far away as
	  Scotland came to purchase large tracts of land for no more than five
	  schillings an acre. Some of the land was given by Bounty Grants to
	  veterans of the Revolutionary War. Early records show on October 15, 1773
	  Benjamin Thompson with his wife and 12 sons and 5 daughters received 750
	  acres on Rocky Creek, north side of Little River including improvement
	  made by Thomas Crocker. Thomas and Arthur Crocker and Benjamin Thompson
	  were found on a petition filed by James Hammett in Spartanburg, 96</span><sup><span class="style6">th</span></sup><span class="style6">,
	  South Carolina on July 5, 1771 in a dispute over land. James and brothers
	  John, William and Robert Hammett were showing up on early court and tax
	  records for Wilkes County Georgia as early as 1779. Thomas Crocker, listed
	  as a planter, shows up again as administrator of will for Joseph Harper on
	  January 15, 1784. That same year was when numerous families from several
	  Counties of Virginia migrated to the same area of Georgia. The families
	  included Brewer, Crowley, Fletcher, Hooper, Myrick, Strong, Wakefield,
	  Moore, Thompson and Young. Jeffrey Crowley, William Strong and George
	  Young Sr. traveled together from Pittsylvania County Virginia that winter.
	  This is the same year that William, Burwell and George Brewer Jr. along
	  with families and cousins were said to have come from the Brunswick County
	  Virginia area. Howell Brewer was also on a petition signed in Wilkes
	  County that year. The Howell Brewer that was found in Georgia from
	  1784-1805 was probably Howell Jr. the son of Howell Brewer Sr. and nephew
	  of Burwell, cousin to William. Howell Brewer Sr. born C1720 was the
	  youngest son of George Brewer &amp; Sarah Lanier. After Sarah died George
	  Brewer married Alice Burwell and had son Burwell. Howell Jr. was born
	  C1742 and whose mom was either Rebecca Willis or Marian May, depending on
	  who you ask. Howell Sr. &amp; Jr. were listed on a petition in Randolph County
	  North Carolina in 1785. Nimrod, Isaac and Reuben Brewer also were listed
	  on this petition that was trying to have the court house moved to a more
	  central location. It is assumed that most of those who were on the
	  petition lived in the lower Southeast part of Randolph county. Nimrod
	  shows up as a single male living in Moore County North Carolina in 1790.
	  Howell Sr. is listed on the Randolph County census with 2 other males
	  above age 16 and 8 females. Isaac states in his revolutionary war
	  deposition that he left North Carolina at the age of 24 or 25 and went to
	  live in Hancock County Georgia. At that age this would’ve been in the year
	  1787/88. Isaac’s brother Simon was born in 1775 that is how I’ve concluded
	  that the Howell listed on the 1790 census is Howell Sr. because no males
	  are listed under age 16. By1794 Howell Jr., Isaac and Nimrod are all three
	  found in Hancock County Georgia. They all stayed in the area that was once
	  Wilkes County with each migrating at different times to the Northwestern
	  frontier. </span></p>
	  <p class="style13">It is unknown but a possibility that most if not all
	  that left Virginia and were in Wilkes County Georgia by 1785 may have
	  traveled together. November 27, 1786, Peter, Daniel and Jacob Bankston of
	  Wilkes County Georgia are shown selling land to Matthew Wood. This land
	  belonged to their father Laurence, born 1704, and was willed to their
	  mother Rebecca Hendricks. The land was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and
	  stands recorded in the Docket of the State of Penna.</p>
	  <p class="style13">Burwell Brewer’s son William born 1756 was married to
	  Elizabeth Holman and had daughters Elizabeth &amp; Sarah who were married to
	  Leslie Coates &amp; Simeon Coates Bankston, sons of John Bankston. John
	  Bankston born 1754, married to Henrietta Coates, was the son of Jacob
	  Bankston born 1731 &amp; Elinor Cox. Jacob &amp; Elinor also had a son named
	  Elijah born 1756 who was the father of Elijah Jr. born C1792 who married
	  Rachel Crocker, daughter of Arthur Crocker &amp; Elizabeth Wakefield.
	  Elizabeth Wakefield was believed to be the daughter of Henry Wakefield and
	  Elizabeth Alexander and her brother Charles B. Wakefield born 1780 married
	  Anna Wakefield who was the daughter of Rachel Martha Bankston born 1760
	  and another Charles Wakefield who was said to be a distant cousin of
	  Charles B. &amp; Elizabeth. Rachel’s brother James born1765 married Judith Lee
	  and had son Andrew Bankston born 1787 in North Carolina. Rachel Martha and
	  James were children of Andrew Bankston born 1727 who was also the son of
	  Laurence and Rebecca. </p>
	  <p class="style13">In 1789 Thomas Crocker was living in Greene County
	  Georgia in the William Houghton district along with Charles, John and
	  George Brewer. Thomas Crocker, in 1793, is among tax defaulters list for
	  Washington County Georgia. </p>
	  <p class="style13">In 1794 on the Hancock County Georgia tax list Howell,
	  Isaac, Nimrod and John Brewer along with Thomas, John, Elijah and Clement
	  Moore were all listed in the Sanford district and tax payers list for
	  1795. Arthur Crocker and Nimrod Brewer were both found on the tax list of
	  Hancock County, Georgia, Sanford district in 1796. Arthur was a resident
	  of Hancock County on the 1805 land lottery. James Crocker, in 1798, is
	  listed on a tax list for the Sanford district. Howell Brewer is then found
	  on the tax list in Clarke County Georgia, Reynolds district in 1802 along
	  with Elijah Bankston Sr. These two men are also listed as residents of
	  Clarke County Georgia on the 1805 land lottery list along with Jacob &amp;
	  John Bankston, William Crocker &amp; John Wakefield and many other Bankston’s.
	  William Crocker also owned and sold land in Greene County in 1807. The
	  Creek and Cherokee Indians occupied the upper region of Georgia starting
	  at about the Jackson and Hall counties border in the early 1800’s until
	  they were forced out about 1830. Residents of Georgia could register as
	  early as May of 1803 for Indian land that was ceded in 1802 for the first
	  land lottery to be held in 1805. Also in 1805, the government negotiated
	  the Treaty of Tellico with the Cherokees and the Treaty of Washington with
	  the Creeks allowing the right to open and operate roads through Indian
	  lands. </p>
	  <p class="style13">The road that would be used to connect white settlers
	  with new frontier in Tennessee, Kentucky and Illinois was known by several
	  names. The most used name was The Federal Road also known as Georgia and
	  Cisca Road. Much of this route followed an old Cherokee trading path and
	  would later be part of what is known as the Trail of Tears. The Federal
	  Road also had a route that ran from the same area in Georgia to the lower
	  part of Alabama to Fort Mims close to the Mississippi border. Some of the
	  interconnected family members did leave Georgia before many of the others.
	  Henry Wakefield, father of Elizabeth Wakefield Crocker, was in Smith
	  County Tennessee with second wife Mary Simpson by August 1800 when their
	  second son John was born. This is where Elizabeth’s brother, Charles B.
	  Wakefield married Anna Wakefield, as mentioned, in Smith County, Tennessee
	  in 1801. In documents titled “The Territorial Papers of the United States”
	  was a petition to congress signed by inhabitants of Randolph and St. Clair
	  Illinois Counties. This petition to the Senate and House of
	  Representatives was asking as true citizens who left the more thickly
	  populated parts of the United States they be granted every possible right
	  to purchase the land in what was most Southern Illinois as soon as the
	  land was put up for sale by the government. A reference was made to the
	  fact that Spain was inviting them to move across the Mississippi to
	  Missouri. The names were many of those who later settled into Shelby
	  County. These included Charles Wakefield Sr. and Charles Jr., James
	  Wakefield and Andrew Bankston. The first settlements east of Silver Creek
	  were made by these men and others in the year 1804. By 1807 these
	  squatters were allowed to make application for land. Andrew Bankston is
	  shown situated on Silver Creek joining James Crocker. Nimrod Brewer is
	  found as early as 1803 in the Randolph County Illinois area which was
	  still considered Indiana territory. He is listed on an early census for
	  that area in 1806 and 1807.The 1806 census had many that had come from
	  Georgia. Listed were Andrew, Charles, Silas and James Bankston, Thomas and
	  John Crocker, Obadiah and James Hooper and Charles Wakefield. There was a
	  Martin Brewer listed whom I haven’t placed and is not found again. Elijah
	  Bankston Jr. was the son of Elijah Sr. who remained in Georgia. Elijah Jr.
	  probably migrated to Illinois with the other Bankston’s or Bankson’s as it
	  was sometimes spelled.</p>
	  <p class="style13">It appears that many of those in Georgia who did not
	  receive land in the 1805 lottery left Georgia and headed northwest to
	  Tennessee, Kentucky or Illinois or went west to Alabama, Mississippi,
	  Arkansas or Louisiana. Jacob Fletcher Brewer born 1794 in Georgia and was
	  married to Edeith Crocker, also daughter of Elizabeth and Arthur Crocker
	  who was last found in Georgia on an 1807 Baldwin county tax list along
	  with Isaac Brewer. Arthur and family left Georgia not long after this if
	  not that year. Around the time Illinois became a territory, marriage
	  records for St. Clair, Illinois show that Elizabeth “Betsy” Crocker
	  married Simeon Wakefield on June 5, 1808. Andrew Bankson married Elizabeth
	  Moore on May 1, 1808 and Elijah Bankston Jr. married Rachel Crocker on
	  November 28, 1809. Much of St. Clair County was un-ceded Indian lands in
	  1810, especially the northern and eastern areas. Elijah Jr. and Andrew
	  were both great-grandsons of Laurence Bankston and Rebecca Hendricks.
	  There was a St Louis Missouri census in 1810 and 1811 in which the
	  residents were listed as petitioners. Among the names listed were Jacob
	  Brewer, Daniel, James and Wholman Bankston and Daniel, John and Thomas
	  Moore, William Hooper and John Carson. It would be hard to prove if these
	  were part of the families that migrated from Georgia to Illinois. But with
	  St. Louis being right across the river from St. Clair and Randolph County
	  Illinois it would have been a huge coincidence if they weren’t.</p>
	  <p class="style13">On June 14, 1812 the United States had declared war
	  with Great Britain. Many of the men already mentioned were now found on
	  the muster rolls in the Illinois territory. In Captain Jacob Short’s
	  Company of mounted rangers Andrew Bankston is Second Lieutenant. The
	  Privates listed were: Elijah Bankston Jr., Jacob and Thomas Crocker, James
	  and William Moore, Charles, George and John A. Wakefield. These men were
	  called into actual service from February 27, 1813 to May 31, 1813 by
	  Governor and Commander-in-Chief Ninian Edwards. </p>
	  <p class="style13">In Captain Nathan Chambers Company of militia listed
	  James Bankston as a Sergeant and James Crocker as a Corporal. The Privates
	  were: Patton Bankston, William and John Crocker, Robert Moore, Simeon and
	  William Wakefield. They were called into service from April 12, 1813 to
	  May 12, 1813. Jacob Fletcher Brewer is believed to have married Edeith
	  Crocker C1813 with their first daughter being born in 1814. Since Jacob
	  was not among those enlisted in Illinois may prove that he was in Missouri
	  at that time. </p>
	  <p class="style13">It is part of the Moultrie County Illinois history that
	  Elizabeth Crocker would not allow her daughter Keziah to be married at
	  home because her other daughters had ran off to get married against her
	  wishes and considered it bad luck for Keziah to be married at home. Her
	  oldest two daughters were Rachel and Edeith. On December 18, 1828 Keziah
	  Matlida Crocker married James Carson which was to be the first in the
	  county and was performed by Charles Wakefield in Boiling Springs.</p>
	  <p class="style14"><font class="style6" size="3">Thomas Crocker was the
	  first of the Crocker family to purchase land in the Illinois area on
	  September 10, 1814 in St. Clair County. He acquired 480 acres in all which
	  eventually is acquired by his wife Elizabeth. It is assumed that Thomas
	  had died before this since he is not found on the 1818 or 1820. Assuming
	  from his will I have determined that Thomas is probably the youngest
	  brother of Arthur. And that they both may descend from the Thomas found in
	  Georgia in 1784. It has not been proven which family in Georgia that Jacob
	  Sr. descended from and whether or not they migrated the same time as the
	  other families mentioned. He is more than likely a son of Nimrod who lived
	  in Hancock County Georgia with Arthur Crocker and migrated to Illinois
	  about the same time as Thomas Crocker and many Bankston’s. Many of the
	  Brewer’s that migrated to Illinois and Missouri between 1800 and 1850 were
	  from North Carolina. The only Brewer’s found that were born in Georgia
	  were Howell Nimrod born 1791/93, Jacob Fletcher born 1794/95 and Erwin or
	  Irwin born C1800. All three of these Brewer’s from Georgia eventually
	  settled and died in different Counties of Missouri. I also believe that
	  Nimrod is a son of Howell Brewer Jr. Some of this is not proven and may
	  never be, for now it can only be speculated.</font></p>
	  <p align="CENTER" class="style10">Howell Brewer Jr.</p>
	  <p class="style13">Howell Brewer Jr., as mentioned is the son of Howell
	  Sr. and grandson of George Brewer and Sarah Lanier. Much of the
	  information published, mostly on the internet, is wildly speculated
	  because there are no real records to verify. One of the biggest debates is
	  which children descended from Sr. or Jr. It was almost impossible to trace
	  daughters during this time. The list I have made is for the possible sons
	  of Howell Jr. starting with Isaac Brewer who was born in Wilkes County
	  Georgia on May 15, 1763. Isaac filed a revolutionary war deposition in
	  1852 which gave a wealth of information but still left room for
	  speculation. He claimed to have had seven children and raised two orphans
	  but only gave the names of two. So I based my speculation on Isaac’s
	  deposition and various petitions, tax list and census. It also may be
	  noted that most of Howell Jr.’ son’s names are biblical. Isaac, Nimrod and
	  Reuben were all on the North Carolina Petition, as previously mentioned,
	  along with Howell Jr. and Sr.</p>
	  <p class="style6">Names of any daughters may never be known. Here are some
	  of the speculated sons:</p>
	  <p><font class="style5" face="Bookman Old Style, serif" size="3">
	  <span class="style3">Isaac Brewer</span><span class="style1"> born May 15,

	  <p><font class="style5" face="Bookman Old Style, serif" size="3">
	  <span class="style3">George Brewer</span><span class="style1"> born 1773</span></font></p>
	  <p><font class="style5" face="Bookman Old Style, serif" size="3">
	  <span class="style3">Simon Brewer</span><span class="style1"> born 1775</span></font></p>
	  <p align="CENTER" class="style10">Nimrod Brewer</p>
	  <p class="style14">
	  <font class="style5" face="Bookman Old Style, serif" size="3">
	  <span class="style1">The only information found on Nimrod is the places he
	  was found which most of the time was near where Howell Brewer Jr. and/or
	  Isaac Brewer were found. That along with his probable son, Howell Nimrod
	  that is how I’ve concluded him as a son of Howell Jr. Although he could be
	  part of the Lanier or Lanier Brewer Jr. descendants. The reason I believe
	  that he is the father of Jacob Fletcher Brewer Sr. is that he lived in the
	  same County in Georgia as Arthur Crocker and then migrated to Illinois as
	  early as 1803 along with a few Crocker’s, Bankston’s and Wakefield family
	  members. Howell Nimrod Brewer was born 1791/93 in Georgia and lived and
	  died in Missouri. There is a tax listing for a Nimrod Brewer in Lawrence
	  County Missouri in 1815. At the time Lawrence County stretched across the
	  bottom Southern part of Missouri. It is possible this record was for
	  Howell Nimrod who was later found in Iron and Madison Counties. The
	  timeline for Nimrod is:</span></font></p>

	  <span class="style3">Jacob Brewer Sr. and Edeith Crocker</span></u><span class="style1">
	  </span></font></p>
	  <p class="style13">Jacob Fletcher Brewer Sr. is shown on census to have
	  been born in Georgia in 1794/95. Jacob Brewer Sr. was not found in
	  Illinois until the 1820 census although He and Edeith would have had to
	  marry sometime in 1813. Their oldest son, Seaburn, is shown on two
	  censuses to have been born in Missouri. Their son John W. is shown to have
	  been born in Missouri on one census then Illinois on another. Jacob was
	  not among those enlisted in the war of 1812 as the Crocker’s and many
	  others were. Also no marriage record has ever been found in Illinois for
	  Jacob and Edeith. This could prove that this was the Jacob Brewer listed
	  in St Louis in 1811. Jacob served on the first Grand Jury in Shelby County
	  Illinois on September 16, 1828. On the 1830 census he is found again
	  living next to Arthur and brother-in-laws John and William Crocker along
	  with James Carson who was married to Keziah Crocker, Arthur’s daughter.
	  This was in precinct 2 of Shelby County where Elijah Bankston Jr. and
	  Hanson Middleton were also living. Elijah Bankston Jr. married Rachel
	  Crocker, daughter of Arthur, on November 28, 1809 in St. Clair County
	  Illinois. Hanson Middleton, found living next to Arthur’s son Thomas,
	  would marry Jacob and Edeith’s daughter Surena in 1833.Jacob purchased
	  land in Shelby County on March 21, 1837. And he is said to have purchased
	  40 acres from his son Seaburn and wife Mariah on December 31, 1838 with
	  Mariah signing release of right and dower to the sale. Jacob and Edith and
	  family remained in Shelby County Illinois until about 1852. Jacob first
	  purchased land in Polk County Missouri on December 1, 1853. He purchased
	  eighty acres at the Springfield land office. The register shows he was a
	  resident of Laclede County Missouri, just east of Polk County. On June 1,
	  1859 he purchased 96 more acres.</p>
	  <p class="style13">Jacob Sr. and son John W. are listed in an 1854 tax
	  assessment book for Polk County Missouri. By 1860 Jacob Sr. and Edeith are
	  found in Polk Co. Missouri along with their sons John Wesley, Samuel, and
	  Jacob Jr. with their families. On the 1860 census of Polk County Missouri
	  it shows that neither Edeith nor Jacob could read or write. Jacob Sr. did
	  well as a farmer with land value of $2,000 and $1,000 in other assets
	  reported. In 1862, Jacob Sr. and Edeith are listed among many of the
	  citizens of this area who signed loyalty oaths to protect, support and
	  defend Provisional Constitution and Government of the U.S. It is believed
	  that Jacob Sr. died sometime before 1865. Some time before August in 1863,
	  Edeith along with Maranda’s father William Clark, traveled by horse and
	  wagon to Cape Girardeau Missouri to bring home John W. who had been
	  injured in the war. John W. died before August 13, 1863 when America filed
	  for pension. This may indicate that Jacob Sr. was already deceased.
	  Although on a tax assessment taken in September 1863 a Jacob Brewer is
	  listed with total property value of $500, possibly Jacob Jr. </p>
	  <p class="style6">Neither Jacob Sr. nor Edeith are found on the 1870
	  census or thereafter.</p>

	  <p class="style13">Surena Laraney was the oldest child of Jacob Brewer and
	  Edeith Crocker. Hanson was most likely the son of Rueben Middleton who
	  served in the war of 1812 in the same company as Arthur, John &amp; William
	  Crocker. Rueben was found in Washington County in 1820 with a son Hanson’s
	  age. Hanson was listed living next to Arthur’s son Thomas on the 1830
	  Shelby county Illinois census. This Thomas Crocker was the son of Arthur
	  who married Nancy Middleton on March 26, 1827 in Shelby County by Simeon
	  Wakefield. Nancy may have been a sister to Hanson. Seaburn Brewer and
	  Hanson both were shown buying land in Shelby County in the same area but
	  neither was found on the 1840 census. Hanson Middleton was born in 1803
	  and died December 10, 1856. He married Surena on October 24, 1833 in
	  Shelby County and they are both buried side by side at Ridge Cemetery in
	  Cold Spring Township where they were found on census in 1850. </p>

	  <p class="style10"><u>Seaburn Brewer and Mariah Walis </u></p>
	  <p class="style13">It is not known what family Mariah descended from but
	  possible her surname may have been misspelled on the marriage certificate
	  since this there are various ways of spelling that sound the same such as
	  Wallace or Wallice. Jacob Sr. served on the first grand jury, in 1828,
	  with a James Wallice who was found in Sangamon County Illinois in 1830.
	  But Mariah was likely the daughter of Jacob Wallace who was in Gallatin
	  County, in 1830, with daughters of Mariah’s age. Jacob Wallace was shown
	  buying land in Shelby County from 1832 to 1850. It may have been his widow
	  Mary in Christian County Illinois in 1860. Seaburn was mentioned in Arthur
	  Crocker’s will receiving one yearling dated February 27, 1835. Seaburn is
	  shown purchasing land in Shelby County on March 16, 1837 and August 13,
	  1839. Their youngest child, Samuel T., was shown being born in Illinois in
	  1859. They were found living in Christian County Illinois in 1860 and next
	  found in Webster County Missouri on the 1870 census. It shows that neither
	  Seaburn nor Mariah could read or write. The oldest child still living at
	  home in 1860 was John N. who was born C1844 in Illinois also. They were
	  married on January 23, 1838 in Shelby County Illinois so there are surely
	  more children. A Joseph Brewer is listed next to Jacob Sr. on the 1861 tax
	  assessment for Polk County. On the 1870 census for Cherokee, Kansas there
	  is a Joseph listed born C1837 in Illinois. Census records were not always
	  accurate with birth dates. Seaburn’s name was mistakenly transcribed by
	  some as Izburn on the marriage license, but viewing it myself it was
	  written as Seburn. On both censuses Seaburn is shown as being born in
	  Missouri, possible but not proven. </p>

	  land in Shelby County on August 13, 1839 but was still living at home when
	  the 1840 census was taken. Their first three children were born in
	  Kentucky from 1844 to 1848. Then they are back in Shelby County Illinois
	  by the 1850 census with America’s sister Hulda being part of the
	  household. Hulda was married to Jacob Jr.’s father-in-law, William Clark,
	  after his first wife died in 1856. According to the place of birth for
	  daughter Eda, they were in Missouri by 1852. As mentioned earlier. Some
	  time before August in 1863, John’s mother Edeith along with Maranda’s
	  father William Clark, traveled by horse and wagon to Cape Girardeau
	  Missouri to bring home John W. who had been injured in the war. John W.
	  died before August 13, 1863 when America filed for pension.</p>

	  who was living in the same area of Shelby County with 2 sons of the right
	  age. Thomas purchased land February 2, 1836 and. Jackson purchased land on
	  December 19, 1838 in Shelby County in the same area as Seaburn Brewer and

	  Lucinda‘s son Sylvester shows up on the ledger from Thomas A. Peters that
	  listed loyalty oaths given by residents of Polk County in 1862. It is
	  assumed Jackson may have died in the war. Lucinda is found living in

	  lived in separate counties according to land records the Brewer’s and
	  Tipsword’s were neighbors. Ruth was born around 1832 as she was 18 years
	  old on the 1850 census. Jacob’s brother John W. signed an oath stating
	  Ruth’s age. They were married in Fayette County Illinois on July 10, 1851.

	  <p class="style10"><u>Jacob Brewer Jr. and Maranda Clark</u></p>
	  <p class="style13">Maranda Clark was the daughter of William Clark and
	  Rachel Starkey. She was born in Ohio on August 16, 1834. Jacob and Maranda
	  were married in Polk County Missouri on December 15, 1855 not long after
	  the family migrated there. They are listed on the 1860 census still in
	  Polk County with three of their children plus Jacob’s daughter Julia.
	  According to the place of birth of several of their children they were in
	  Nebraska from 1866 to 1868. Jacob Jr. and family are found in Nodaway Co.,
	  Missouri on the 1870 census where Jacob Jr. is listed as a shingle maker.
	  From there they moved to Monona Co., Iowa where Jacob Jr. died of Typhoid
	  fever on Nov.15, 1878. He is buried in the Belvedere Cemetery in Monona
	  Co., Iowa. Jacob Jr’s widow, Maranda, and family remained in Monona Co.,
	  Iowa. Two of their sons, William and Sylvester, would eventually marry
	  sisters Dora and Libbie Piatt. They were the daughters of Lafayette Piatt
	  and Eliza Cole. William and Sylvester’s brother, George, was engaged to
	  Katie Piatt. She was said to already have the wedding dress when it was
	  called off. Supposedly George was not well liked by Lafayette. Sylvester
	  and Libbie would eventually divorce which was uncommon for the time. Will
	  and Dora remained in Monona Co. and are both buried there along with their
	  son Aaron and daughter Maude. Sylvester lived with Will and Dora at the
	  time they were expecting their son along with a farm hand named Aaron.
	  They both told Dora if she named the baby after them they would buy the
	  baby’s first outfit. So she named their son Aaron Sylvester and both had
	  to live up to his word. December 2, 1886, Maranda married Charles Henry
	  Cooper, father of her son-in-law Charles Leroy Cooper (Sarah’s husband).
	  Maranda died November 10, 1903 and is buried in the Belvedere cemetery in
