**Delaware Pigg Shot by Deputy Sheriff**  
Son Shoots Officer Who Killed Father During Arrest

**Florence, Ala., Jan. 21** — Word was received here today of a fatal shooting between a deputy sheriff and a farmer at Lutts, Tennessee, twenty miles from here, late Wednesday night.

Delaware Pigg, the farmer, was instantly killed by Deputy A. B. Gillis of Lutts, who was twice shot by a son of the farmer. Gillis was taken to a hospital. The son escaped.

The shooting occurred, authorities said, when Gillis went to the Pigg farm to arrest the son on a charge of stealing. The elder Pigg was said to have attempted to shoot the deputy, but his gun jammed, and when it did Gillis opened fire.

While Gillis was being rushed to a surgeon's office for emergency treatment, the farmer's son fled in an automobile. He had shot the deputy, authorities said, when his father fell before the deputy's fire.
