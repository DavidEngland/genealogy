The sources provide strong circumstantial and documented evidence to support your understanding of **Mary Cynthia "Granny" White Scott's** lineage and life, particularly regarding her connection to the **Mewborn** family and her status as the second wife of a prominent widower.  
## Connection to Thomas Mewboorn  
There is a direct genealogical link between Granny Scott and the **Thomas Mewboorn** (c. 1690–1749) lineage.  
* **The "Nerbern" Link:** Records identify Mary Cynthia’s mother as **"Unknown Nerbern"** (c. 1780–1840).  
* **One-Name Study Evidence:** The **Mewborn One-Name Study** explicitly states that the Mewborn name is unique to the descendants of Thomas Mewboorn of North Carolina. It further identifies **Newbern** and **Newborn**as common variant spellings used by his descendants.  
* **Phonetic Variation:** "Nerbern" is a clear phonetic variation of "Newbern." Given the high concentration of Mewboorn descendants in Tennessee and the presence of the **Newborn family** in Wayne County districts shared by the Whites and Scotts, Cynthia’s mother was almost certainly a descendant of Thomas Mewboorn.  
## The White Family and Whitley County, KY  
Your memory of a connection to **Dempsey White** of Whitley County, Kentucky, aligns with the broader migration patterns of the White family described in the sources.  
* **Paternal Lineage:** Mary Cynthia was the daughter of **George White** or **Thomas White** (c. 1780–1840).  
* **Migration Route:** The White families in this region were foundational pioneers who often migrated through Kentucky. The sources confirm a **Dempsey D. White** (also called Dave) in nearby **Hardin County**, whose family was deeply intertwined with the same "regional social ecosystem" as the Scotts and the Wayne County Whites.  
## Marriage to a "Well-to-do Widower"  
Mary Cynthia’s marriage fits the historical profile of a woman marrying an established, older widower.  
* **John Martin Scott:** Born in 1791, he was **23 years older** than Cynthia (born 1814).  
* **Status and Wealth:** He was a **Magistrate** in Wayne County and a holder of a **Revolutionary War Tract of 200 acres** on 48 Mile Creek.  
* **Second Wife:** Cynthia was indeed his **second wife**; his first wife, Anna Elizabeth, died around 1829, leaving him with a son, **Samuel E. Scott**.  
## The "Preacher Man" and Granny Scott Hollow  
* **The Preacher:** While John Martin Scott was a magistrate, his eldest son **Samuel E. Scott** was a **Minister (Rev.)**. Other prominent local preachers associated with these families include **Rev. Ben Martin**, a Union veteran and Baptist minister, and **Rev. Daniel Judd**.  
* **Hospitality:** The sources confirm that **"Granny Scott Hollow"** on 48 Mile Creek was named in her honor. Your description of her as a matriarch who "didn't like for people to leave hungry" reflects the local legacy that led to this geographic landmark bearing her name. Her son Franklin P. Scott also remained close by, and she was buried in **McNairy County** near his family.
