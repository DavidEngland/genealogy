			<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><strong>OUR HARGRAVE FAMILY AND THE WAR OF 1812</strong></p>
<p>AS WE ALL KNOW, wars just never start on a Tuesday afternoon for no particular reason. There is always a laundry list of contributing factors which begin to make trouble long before the shooting starts. The list provided by Wikipedia has eleven entries which may be useful to you depending on your level of interest. Beyond the list, there is a timeline that provides links to practically every event for the entirety of the war both on land and sea.</p>
<p>This piece is an attempt to address the War of 1812 as it impacted our family. Because so many of our men and boys served during the conflict from Kentucky and Illinois, I have chosen to focus on the battles in what was then America’s northwestern frontier. My list of Hargrave men and sons-in-law whose service is documented has 15 names on it. I probably missed some.</p>
<p>I have to begin by saying that I think that the War of 1812 could be categorized as a conflict of Indians vs White Settlers with some help from the Brits and not be far off the mark. I also have to say that I am of two minds about the conflict. I get that the growing white population needed room to grow but I also believe that the native people had every right to protect their lives and lands. I must also say that, had Tecumseh and the British General Isaac Brock survived, our history of the upper Midwest might read very differently.</p>
<p>Mrs Mozelle Hilliard was my amazing U S History Teacher in high school. I loved her energy and enthusiasm for the subject and have always credited her with my own ever-growing interest, but I have to say that working on this particular project has brought me face to face with my own ignorance. ‘Tippecanoe and Tyler too’. William Henry Harrison, the Battle of New Orleans. Wow. Those buzz words were about all that stuck with me. And I had absolutely no idea, for example, that we were planning to conquer Canada.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Militia enlistments</strong> were typically for no more than 6 months. In peace time, the men and older boys only mustered once a year, usually in the fall after the crops were in. That’s not a lot of time to absorb formal military training.</p>
<p>During the War of 1812, the <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Illinois</span> militia units</strong> were tasked with defending the home ground while the <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kentucky</span> militia</strong> served alongside federal troops in the major battles. I recommend a visit to the Kentucky National Guard website. Their history section is outstanding. The Illinois National Guard website is interesting also but does not address the War of 1812.</p>

He negotiated the&nbsp;<a title="Treaty of Detroit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Detroit">Treaty of Detroit</a> in 1807, with the&nbsp;<a title="Ottawa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, <a title="Chippewa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chippewa">Chippewa</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Wyandot people" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people">Wyandot</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Potawatomi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a>&nbsp;nations, which ceded most of present-day&nbsp;<a title="Southeast Michigan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Michigan">Southeast Michigan</a>&nbsp;to the United States.&nbsp;These efforts to expand white settlement began to generate opposition, particularly from the&nbsp;<a title="Shawnee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee">Shawnee</a>&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;<a title="Tecumseh" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>&nbsp;and his brother&nbsp;<a title="Tenskwatawa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenskwatawa">Tenskwatawa</a>, the Shawnee Prophet, who preached resistance to the American lifestyle and to further land giveaways.</p>
<p>Indiana Territorial Governor&nbsp;<a title="William Henry Harrison" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>&nbsp;went against the wishes of President James Madison and negotiated The&nbsp;Treaty of Fort Wayne in 1809. The treaty opened 3,000,000 acres of&nbsp;<a title="American Indians in the United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indians_in_the_United_States">American Indian</a>&nbsp;land for the white settlers of&nbsp;<a title="Illinois" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois">Illinois</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Indiana" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana">Indiana</a>. The tribes ceding land included the&nbsp;<a title="Delaware tribe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_tribe">Delaware</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Eel River tribe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eel_River_tribe">Eel River</a><a title="Miami tribe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_tribe">Miami</a>, and the<a title="Potawatomi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a>&nbsp;in the initial negotiations and later&nbsp;the <a title="Kickapoo people" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickapoo_people">Kickapoo</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a title="Wea" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wea">Wea</a>, who were the primary inhabitants of the region. These negotiations did not include the&nbsp;<a title="Shawnee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee">Shawnee</a>. The Treaty of Fort Wayne led to a war with the&nbsp;<a title="United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> began by Shawnee leader&nbsp;<a title="Tecumseh" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>&nbsp;and other dissenting tribesmen in what came to be called “<a title="Tecumseh's War" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecumseh%27s_War">Tecumseh’s War</a>”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Federal Government</span>: At this turn of events, President Madison hurriedly called on Congress to put the country “into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis,” specifically recommending enlarging the army, preparing the militia, finishing the military academy, stockpiling munitions, and expanding the navy.&nbsp;Madison faced formidable obstacles—a divided cabinet, a factious party, stubborn Congress, obstructionist governors, and incompetent generals, <i>together with militia who refused to fight outside their states</i>. Most serious was lack of unified popular support.&nbsp;The problems were made worse due to Jefferson’s and Madison’s having reduced the military, closed the Bank of the U.S., and narrowed the tax system. Those acts meant that the government could not quickly finance the hiring of mercenaries. By the time the war began, Madison’s military force consisted mostly of poorly trained militia members.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The United States attitude about Canada</span>: The United States first foray into Canada occurred at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, when colonial troops marched all the way to Quebec City before being repelled. By the time the War of 1812 rolled around almost four decades later, the so-called “war hawk” members of Congress were clamoring for a second go-around. There were even a few calls for part or all of Canada to be annexed. At that time around 7.5 million people lived in the United States, compared to only about 500,000 in Canada, many of whom were of French or American descent rather than British. Almost immediately thereafter, President Madison approved a three-pronged assault against Canada. Many Americans believed the invasion would be a cakewalk, particularly since Britain was so distracted by the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. Former President Jefferson called the acquisition of Quebec a “mere matter of marching,” while Speaker of the House Henry Clay, a prominent war hawk, declared that “the militiamen of Kentucky were capable of capturing Upper Canada (modern day Ontario) and Montreal without any assistance.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The United States Army</span>: After the Revolutionary War, &nbsp;the Continental Army was quickly disbanded as part of the American distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the new nation’s sole ground army, with the exception of&nbsp;<a title="First American Regiment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_American_Regiment">a regiment</a>&nbsp;to guard the&nbsp;<a title="Northwest Territory" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territory">Western Frontier</a>&nbsp;and one battery of artillery to guard&nbsp;<a title="West Point" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Point">West Point</a>‘s arsenal. However, because of continuing conflict with&nbsp;<a title="Native Americans in the United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native Americans</a>, it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. At the start of the&nbsp;<a title="War of 1812" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812">War of 1812</a>&nbsp;the regular army totaled less than 12,000 soldiers. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The U S Army 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment </span>was tasked with protecting the Northwestern frontier.<span style="text-decoration:underline;line-height:1.5em;"><br>

<p><i>On July 20, 1810, 40 y/o </i>WILLIS HARGRAVE<i> (son of William and Elizabeth Miles) was appointed Captain in the </i><i>3<sup>rd</sup> Regiment</i><i> of Illinois Militia. ‘(known as Captain Hargrave’s Company of Illinois Mounted Volunteers).</i></p>
<p><i>In mid-1810, the census found his wife, Jane, and the younger children alone in Randolph County in the Illinois Territory. With Willis in the field were sons Seth (age 16) and Samuel (age 20). </i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>TECUMSEH’S WAR:</strong></p>
<p>Shawnee leader, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tecumseh</span>, had been encouraging Indian resistance for some time by telling the tribes to give up all the white man’s ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey. In <span style="text-decoration:underline;">August 1810</span>, he led 400 armed warriors (in full war regalia) down the&nbsp;<a title="Wabash River" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabash_River">Wabash River</a>&nbsp;to meet with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Governor William&nbsp;Henry Harrison</span> at Vincennes. In that meeting, Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate. He argued that no one tribe could sell land without the approval of the other tribes; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms, and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly.</p>
<p>Harrison replied that the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it if they chose to do so. He rejected Tecumseh’s claim that all the Indians formed one nation. He said each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to and argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be one nation.</p>
<p>Tecumseh launched into ‘impassioned speech’, weapons were drawn and things threatened to get out of hand.&nbsp;Potawatomie <a title="Winamac" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamac">Chief Winnemac</a>, who was friendly to Harrison, countered Tecumseh’s arguments and told the warriors that since they had come in peace, they should return home in peace.</p>
<p>Before leaving Vincennes, Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the treaty was nullified, he would seek an alliance with the British.</p>

Fort Knox was located a few miles north.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Harrison left to attend some business in Kentucky. Acting Governor John Gibson received word through a Miami friend that Tecumseh was planning for war. He immediately called out the Illinois militia and sent for Harrison. By-mid-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">September 1811</span>, most of the militia units had formed and Harrison had returned with a small force of U S Army regulars. He had already received authorization (from the U S Secretary of War) to march as a show of force against the Shawnee and Tecumseh’s growing Confederation.</p>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration:underline;">November 1811</span>, Having gathered the scattered militia companies together at Fort Knox, (north of Vincennes) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison</span> led a combined force of about 1000 men northward toward <span style="text-decoration:underline;">PROPHETS TOWN</span> leading an army of&nbsp; about 250&nbsp; U S Army regulars, 100 Kentucky volunteers, and some 600 Indiana militiamen and &nbsp;including 2 companies of Indiana Rangers.</p>
<p>Harrison’s army reached the site of modern day Terra Haute, Indiana on October 3 where they camped and built <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort Harrison</span> while waiting for supplies to arrive.</p>

<p>The advance on Prophet’s Town resumed on October 29. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tenskwatawa</span>, who had been left in charge during Tecumseh’s absence, sent an emissary with a white flag as Harrison’s troops approached requesting a meeting for the following day.

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tenskwatawa</span> (the Prophet), was a spiritual leader but not a soldier. He is said to have promised the warriors magical protections. Worried by the nearby army and fearing an attack, the warriors moved out. Harrison’s sentinels encountered the encroaching warriors and fired warning shots. The soldiers in the camp awoke to find themselves almost surrounded and under attack. Fierce fighting ensured. Two of the Ranger units began a retreat which allowed the attackers to get into the camp. At length, they were repulsed and the breach in the line was closed.</p>
<p>After several more charges failed, the warriors began to run low on ammunition. When the sun came up and revealed how few of them remained on the battlefield, they began to withdraw. A charge by Harrison’s dragoons forced the remaining warriors to flee. The battle had lasted about two hours. Harrison lost 37 men killed in action and 25 mortally wounded.</p>
<p>The warriors returned to Prophetstown where, according to one account, they confronted <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tenskwatawa</span> and accused him of deceit because, despite his magic and his assurances, many of them had died. They also refused to carry out the new attack that he ordered.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison</span> prepared for a second attack that never came. The citizens of Prophetstown abandoned the town overnight. Finding it empty, Harrison’s men confiscated everything of value, including 5,000 bushels of corn and beans and all cooking implements, burned the town and returned home.</p>
<p>I would be remiss to avoid mentioning the scalping and the desecration of graves BY BOTH SIDES that took place. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wikipedia</span> provides a detailed account of the battle and the gruesome aftermath.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison</span>, having accomplished his goal of destroying Prophetstown, proclaimed that he had won a decisive victory. But some of Harrison’s contemporaries raised doubts about whether the expedition had been much of a success. Although the defeat was a setback for Tecumseh’s confederacy, the Natives soon rebuilt the town and frontier violence actually increased after the battle. Public opinion in the United States conveniently blamed the violence on&nbsp;<a title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland">British</a>&nbsp;interference.</p>
<p>I can’t help but think how truly frightening it must have been for our people to know that the Indian Tribes finally had one leader who was powerful and influential enough to pull all the Tribes together and lead them into a united for-all-the-marbles campaign. The attack on Prophetstown seems to have served to create confusion and slow down the Indians’ progress but if Tecumah had not died later in Canada, our history of the American upper mid-west might be very different indeed.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">U S General<b> </b>William<b> </b></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hull</span> (and Governor of the Michigan Territory) arrived in&nbsp;<a title="Cincinnati" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>&nbsp;on May 10. On <span style="text-decoration:underline;">May 25</span>, he took command of the 3 regiments of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ohio militia</span> at&nbsp;<a title="Dayton, Ohio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio">Dayton</a>. They marched to&nbsp;<a title="Staunton Township, Miami County, Ohio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton_Township,_Miami_County,_Ohio">Staunton</a>&nbsp;and then to&nbsp;<a title="Urbana, Ohio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbana,_Ohio">Urbana</a>, (Illinois) where they were joined by the 300-man <span style="text-decoration:underline;">U S Army 4th Infantry Regiment</span><b>. </b>The men of the militia were ill-equipped and averse to strong military discipline, and Hull relied on the infantry regiment to quell several instances of insubordination on the remainder of the march. By the end of June, the army had reached the&nbsp;<a title="Grand Rapids, Ohio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Ohio">rapids</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a title="Maumee River" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maumee_River">Miami River</a> (now known as the Maumee) and on July 11, reached the Detroit River and camped at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort Detroit</span>.</p>
<p>The British, garrisoned on the Canadian side of the Detroit River at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Amherstburg,</span> numbered 100 British regulars, 300 Canadian militiamen and 150 warriors led by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.warof1812.ca/tecumseh.html">Tecumseh</a>. British Colonel <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Henry Proctor</span> was in command.</p>
<p>Moving ahead quickly,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> General Hull</span> crossed the Detroit River on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">July 12</span> and made his headquarters in a Canadian farm house near Sandwich, (now Windsor) Ontario, where he issued a proclamation freeing the Canadian citizenry from British domination. &nbsp;So preoccupied was he with his attempts to terrify (or placate?) the Canadians with printed words that he neglected to protect the American forts on Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>As a result of his inattention, a small force of British and Indians captured <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort Mackinac</span>. After these small but strategic victories, the Indians took such courage that many of them hurried northward from the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to join <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tecumseh</span> on the Canadian frontier. Within a short time, he had more than six hundred warriors ready and eager for battle.</p>
<p>Watching Indian warriors swarm across the border while Canadian militiamen rallied to the defense of their land, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Hull</span> became increasingly nervous. His nervousness finally gave way to near panic at the thought of facing an enemy force of British regulars, sharpshooting backwoodsmen and hundreds of angry Indians. He ordered his army to retreat back across the river to Fort Detroit on August 11th, 1812.</p>
<p>Two days after the withdrawal of the Americans,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.militaryheritage.com/brock.html">General Isaac Brock</a>&nbsp;arrived at Amherstburg, where he held an immediate conference with his officers and with Tecumseh. After a brief consideration of the border situation, Brock decided to cross the river and make a direct attack on Fort Detroit. Pleased with this firm and courageous decision, Tecumseh pointed at the British general and shouted “Ho! Here is a man!”</p>
<p>MEANWHILE, a small American garrison of approximately 60 men under the command of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lieutenant Porter Hanks</span> manned <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">FORT MACKINAC (</span></b>on Mackinac Island in Lake Huron). Although a diligent officer, Hanks had received no communication from his superiors for months and was unaware of the declaration of war. On the morning of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">July 17, 1812</span>, a combined British and&nbsp;<a title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">Indian</a>&nbsp;force of seventy war canoes and ten&nbsp;<a title="Bateaux" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateaux">bateaux</a>&nbsp;under the command of British <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Captain Charles Roberts </span>attacked the fort. Captain Roberts brought his force of several hundred soldiers and warriors from&nbsp;<a title="Fort St. Joseph (Ontario)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_St._Joseph_(Ontario)">Fort St. Joseph (Ontario)</a>&nbsp;and landed on the north end of the island, 2 miles away from the fort. The British quietly removed the village inhabitants from their homes and trained two cannons at the fort. Taken by surprise, Hanks rightly perceived that his garrison was badly outnumbered.</p>

The British paroled the American forces, essentially allowing them to go free after swearing to not take up arms in the war again, and made the island inhabitants to swear an oath of allegiance to Britain.</p>
<p>Afterward, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lieutenant Hanks </span>made his way to Detroit and the American military post there. Upon his arrival, superiors charged him with cowardice in the quick and bloodless surrender of Fort Mackinac. Before his court martial could begin, however, British forces attacked Fort Detroit. A British cannonball ripped through the room where Hanks was standing, cutting him in half and killing the officer next to him as well.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">BATTLE AT BROWNSTOWN CREEK</span>: On August 5, 1812,&nbsp;<a title="Major" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major">Major</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&nbsp;Thomas Van Horne</span> and 200 U.S. Army soldiers were en route <span style="text-decoration:underline;">south</span> to the&nbsp;<a title="River Raisin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Raisin">River Raisin</a>, where they were to pick up cattle and other needed supplies and escort them back to Fort Detroit&nbsp; As they forded BROWNSTOWN CREEK, the soldiers were set upon by two dozen Indians led by the&nbsp;<a title="Shawnee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee">Shawnee</a>&nbsp;war chief&nbsp;<a title="Tecumseh" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Chickamauga Indian" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickamauga_Indian">Chickamauga</a>&nbsp;war chief Daimee,&nbsp;<a title="Wyandot people" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people">Wyandot</a> chief&nbsp;<a title="Roundhead (Wyandot)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhead_(Wyandot)">Roundhead</a>, and several others. Faced with such opposition, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Van Horne</span> ordered a retreat, whereupon the poorly trained soldiers scattered in a panic. Van Horne was able to save only half of his command; 18 men were killed, 12 were wounded, and 70 went missing. Most of those listed as “missing” had scattered during the battle and returned to Detroit over the following days. Tecumseh had about 25 warriors with him.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">THE SURRENDER OF DETROIT</span>: On August 16<sup>th</sup>, under the command of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Isaac Brock</span>, British regulars, Canadian militiamen and the Indian warriors under <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tecumseh</span> advanced on <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">DETROIT</span></b> while the guns at Amherstburg threw shells across the water.

The American forces still outnumbered those of the approaching enemy, but Hull did not know that. Convinced that the situation within in the fort was hopeless, he ran up a white flag and quickly agreed to&nbsp;<a href="http://war1812.tripod.com/surender.html">surrender</a>.</p>
<p>Once the surrender was accomplished, Hull was said to have emerged from his catatonic state like a man coming out of an anesthetic. Scarcely able to speak or act that morning, he later seemed both lucid and serene. “I have done what my conscience directed,” he declared. “I have saved Detroit and the Territory from the horrors of an Indian massacre”. He was court-martialed, and, at a trial presided over by General&nbsp;<a title="Henry Dearborn" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dearborn">Henry Dearborn</a>, sentenced to be shot, though upon recommendation of mercy by the court, he received a reprieve from President&nbsp;<a title="James Madison" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison">James Madison</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the easy victory, the British captured valuable goods, including thirty three cannon, a large quantity of stores and equipment, a number of horses and a newly built sailing ship. As a token of appreciation of Tecumseh’s part in the affair, Brock slipped off his own red military sash and wrapped it about the chief’s waist. In quick response, Tecumseh removed his beaded sash and handed it over to the general. General Brock returned to Niagara fearing the next threat of an American attack would be there.</p>
<p>In mid-August 1812, while the events surrounding Fort Detroit were evolving; after hearing that Fort Mackinac had fallen to the enemy and when his confidence had crumbled, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Hull</span> sent a messenger to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Captain Nathan Heald</span> at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">FORT DEARBORN</span> ordering him to evacuate the inhabitants to the safety of Fort Wayne.</p>

<p>It was true that relations with the nearby Potawatomi and Winnebago peoples had become increasingly strained after William Henry Harrison had been campaigning against them in 1811. &nbsp;Many at the fort were convinced that staying put was less risky than physically exposing themselves on a march. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Captain Heald</span>, though sympathetic to their point of view, could not be persuaded to disobey his commander.</p>
<div class="wordads-ad-wrapper wordads-ad-wrapper--inline"><div class="wordads-ad"><div class="wordads-ad-title">Advertisement</div><div class="wordads-ad-content" id="wordads-ad-733360" data-ad-height="250" data-ad-width="300"></div><div class="wordads-ad-controls"></div></div></div><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">General </span><a href="http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/people/hull.html">Hull</a>&nbsp;had also ordered the destruction of all the fort’s excess arms, ammunition, and whiskey.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Heald</span> was to distribute the remaining goods to the local Indians in the hopes of appeasing them. Blankets and food were not foremost on the Indians’ minds, however, and the whiskey they had hoped to gain had been destroyed. Some sources would later claim that the Indian attack was in retribution for this deed.</p>
<p>Led by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">William (Billy) Wells</span> and accompanied by about 30 Miami warriors, the party of 93 people. (54 soldiers, 12 militiamen, 9 women and 18 children) set out for Fort Wayne. Wells, a white man who had been raised among the Miami, fully expected an ambush and spotted signs of it early in the journey. As he expected, Potawatomie Chief Blackbird and 500 men of the Potawatomi and Winnebago Tribes waited to strike.</p>
<p>While <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wells and Captain Heald</span> led a desperate attack, the Miami warriors realized how badly they were outnumbered and abandoned the wagons leaving the women and children unguarded and helpless. They were quickly overpowered. One bloodthirsty young warrior went so far as to slip into a covered wagon and behead twelve children. Two of the women were killed while fighting to save the young ones.</p>
<p>Half the soldiers were killed and the local militia force of 12 men was systematically wiped out. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Captain Heald</span> was wounded but still alive. Despite his efforts to save the survivors, more were killed after the battle.&nbsp;The Indians sold the prisoners to the British who released them immediately afterwards. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Billy Wells</span> was not so lucky. Although spared by two other leaders, one of the Potawatomie leaders stabbed and killed him then cut his heart out and fed it to his warriors. A tribute, of a gruesome sort, to a brave man. Afterward, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort Dearborn</span> was burned to the ground and the region remained empty of U.S. citizens until after the war had ended.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Massacre of Fort Dearborn</span>, coupled with the British success at Detroit, convinced more of the tribes of the Upper Mississippi and Missouri to join <a href="http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/people/tecumseh.html">Tecumseh</a>‘s growing Confederacy. Within weeks of the outbreak of war, Fort Wayne remained the only U.S. military post on the Northwestern frontier. American hopes of a quick three pronged assault of Canada evaporated.</p>
<p><b>Meanwhile, out of the mainstream of events</b>, in Illinois, following the fall of Fort Dearborn, Illinois <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Governor Ninian Edwards</span> became convinced that the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Potawatomi</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kickapoo</span> peoples were preparing to launch a major attack on the settlements in the southern part of Illinois. In his capacity as commander-in-chief, Edwards took it upon himself to launch a campaign against them. The force of 400 that he assembled included mounted militia volunteers commanded by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Charles Rector</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Benjamin Stephenson</span>. On <span style="text-decoration:underline;">October 18, 1812,</span> Edwards marched north out of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort Russell</span>. Near present day Springfield, they burned two <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kickapoo</span> villages on the Saline Fork of the Sangamon River. From there they turned west and marched to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Peoria</span> where they attacked villages associated with the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kickapoo</span>, the<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Miami</span> and the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Potawatomie. </span>According to Edwards’ report to the Secretary of War, they burned the villages and large amounts of provisions. They also captured 80 horses, killed more than two dozen Indians, and captured 4 prisoners. That accomplished, they returned to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort Russell</span> on November 1, 1812 whereupon Edwards declared that the problems had been solved and released the militia.</p>

<p>A second attack on Peoria took place beginning on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">November 5</span> and ending on November 9 was carried out under the command of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Captain Thomas Craig</span> of the Illinois militia. A large number of French citizens and Potawatomie people were killed. (Google: <i>Captain Thomas Craig’s attack on Peoria</i> for a horrifying account of this action).</p>
<p>These attacks not only aggravated the people of Peoria but angered the U S Government as well because they had been carried out against Indians loyal to Black Partridge and Gomo, two leaders who had stayed clear of Tecumseh’s War and were considered friendly to U S interests. Edwards, having lost the confidence of the Madison administration, decamped and spent the rest of the war in Kentucky but continued as Governor of Illinois until 1818. (I can’t resist adding that one of the Hargrave families named a little girl Ninian).</p>

<p>By 1812, the fort had fallen into disrepair. The walls, once strong enough to withstand cannon balls, had not been maintained and many of the buildings had been allowed to deteriorate. Although there was a good well inside the fort, the food stores had gotten low by September.</p>
<p>On September 4, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Potawatomi</span> chiefs&nbsp;<a title="Winamac" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamac">Winamac</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;<a title="Five Medals" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Medals">Five Medals</a>&nbsp;approached the fort under a&nbsp;<a title="Flag of truce" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_truce#Flag_of_surrender_or_truce">flag of truce</a>&nbsp;and asked to speak to the commander, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Captain James Rhea</span>. Rhea, who had been drinking, met them at the gate and asked if they were meeting for peace or war. Winamac <i>replied “I don’t know what to tell you, but you know that&nbsp;</i><a title="Fort Mackinac" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Mackinac"><i>Fort Mackinac</i></a><i>&nbsp;is taken, Detroit is in the hands of the British, Fort Dearborn has been taken, and you must expect to fall next, probably in a few days.</i>”&nbsp;Rhea invited Winamac to his quarters, where they shared wine. Rhea declared Winamac to be his friend, and invited him back for breakfast the next day. Winamac interpreted feigned friendship as cowardliness, however, and prepared for battle.</p>
<p>The Indian assault on the fort began the following morning. Stilling drinking, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Captain Rhea</span> retired to his quarters claiming illness. The defense of the fort then fell to Indian Agent <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Benjamin Stickney</span> and Lieutenants <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Daniel Curtis</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Philip Ostander</span>. Attacks continued throughout the day and into the evening.</p>
<p>At which point <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Winamac</span> approached the fort and was admitted to parley. During the meeting he drew a knife with the intention of killing Stickney. He was prevented from doing so expelled from the fort. Around 8:00 PM, the Indians renewed their efforts to breach the walls. Fighting continued through the night with the Indians making unsuccessful efforts to set the fort’s walls on fire and into the next day. At about 3:00 PM the next day, chiefs Winamac and Five Medals briefly withdrew but renewed the attack that night.</p>
<p>Having learned of the defeats along the frontier, the Governor of Kentucky, Charles Scott, <i>appointed Indiana Governor <span style="text-decoration:underline;">William Henry Harrison</span> to the rank of Major General in the Kentucky State Militia</i> and directed him to take men to reinforce <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort Wayne</span>. This action was taken despite the fact that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Brigadier General James Winchester</span> was Commander of the U S Army of the Northwest. After dispatching a letter of apology to the U S Secretary of War, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison</span> began moving north with some 2,200 men.</p>

Racing through the Indian lines, they reached the fort and informed the defenders that help was coming after which they escaped and reported back to Harrison.</p>
<p>Though pleased that the fort was holding, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison</span> grew concerned when he received reports that T<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ecumseh</span> was leading a mixed force of over 500 Indian and British troops towards Fort Wayne. Driving his men forward, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison</span> reached the St Mary’s River on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">September 8</span> where he was reinforced by 800 militiamen from Ohio.</p>
<p>With Harrison approaching, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Winamac</span> and his warriors mounted a final assault against the fort on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">September 11</span>. Taking heavy losses, he broke off the attack on the 12<sup>th</sup> and directed his warriors to fall back across the Maumee River. Pushing on, Harrison reached the fort later that same day and relieved the garrison.</p>
<p>IN THE INTERVAL:&nbsp; Assuming command, Harrison arrested Captain Rhea and placed <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lieutenant Phillip Ostander</span> in command of the fort. Two days later, he began sending out squads to conduct punitive raids against Indian villages in the region. Operating from Fort Wayne, his troops burned Forks of the Wabash (Miami) as well as Five Medals Village (Potawatomie). &nbsp;Trimble continued on towards the Eel River with half his troops to seek and destroy Miami villages ( in present day Whitley County). Two villages were destroyed before the Miami stood and fought back. Fear of Indian reprisals forced Trimble to return to Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>General James Winchester soon arrived at Fort Wayne, and relieved <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison</span> who then took his militia force to&nbsp;<a title="Piqua, Ohio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piqua,_Ohio">Piqua, Ohio</a>, where he joined with 1,000 additional men of the Kentucky militia. <i>When <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison received news that he was now in command of the U S Northwestern Army</span></i>, he set out on yet another expedition to destroy villages, this time on the&nbsp;<a title="St. Joseph River (Maumee River)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph_River_(Maumee_River)">St. Joseph River</a>.</p>

<p>On <span style="text-decoration:underline;">September 3, 1812</span>, a band of&nbsp;friendly <a title="Miami tribe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_tribe">Miami</a>&nbsp;arrived and warned Captain Taylor that they would soon be attacked by a large force of warriors. Most of the garrison of 50 was down sick. With only 15 able soldiers and about 5 healthy settlers, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Taylor</span> made ready for the expected attack. Each of the 20 men was issued sixteen rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>On September 4, a fighting force of 600 <a title="Wea" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wea">Wea</a>, <a title="Shawnee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee">Shawnee</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Kickapoo people" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickapoo_people">Kickapoo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Ho-Chunk" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho-Chunk">Winnebago</a>&nbsp;warriors approached the fort. A party of 40 men under command of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kickapoo Chief Namahtoha</span> approached under a flag of truce and asked to parley with Taylor the next morning. Taylor agreed, and the Indians withdrew.</p>
<p>During the night, a warrior crawled up and set the blockhouse on fire. While the sentries opened fire on the arsonist, the war party attacked the west side of the fort. Taylor ordered the fort’s surgeon and a handful of defenders to control the fire but the blockhouse (which was attached to the barracks) had a store of whiskey which soon ignited causing the fire rage out of control. He then organized a&nbsp;<a title="Bucket brigade" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_brigade">bucket brigade</a>to fight the fire before it could destroy the fort’s picket walls.</p>
<p>Although Taylor later admitted in his report that with the situation looking hopeless, and that, after having had two of his healthy men flee the fort, he had nevertheless warned the rest that “Taylor never surrenders!”</p>
<p>The fire did serve one useful purpose in that it revealed the positions of the attackers. But it had created left a 20-foot-wide<b> </b>gap in the outer wall. While the able members of the garrison scrambled to close the gap by throwing up a 5-foot-high breast work, the sick men came on line and fired steadily, allowing them to hold off the attack. The Indian force withdrew just beyond gun range and proceeded to butcher the settlers’ farm animals. The soldiers and settlers inside the fort, meanwhile, had lost most of their food in the fire and had only a few&nbsp;<a title="Bushel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushel">bushels</a> of corn left.</p>

The next day, however, a supply train following Colonel Russell was attacked in what became known as the&nbsp;<i>Attack at the Narrows</i>.</p>
<p><i>In a morning report made at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Camp Russell</span>, dated Sept. 12, 1812: “of the troops under the command of&nbsp;<b>Major Benjamin STEPHENSON</b>, we find companies under the command of Captains&nbsp;<b>James B. MOORE, W. B. WHITESIDE, Absolem COX, Jacob SHORT, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Willis HARGRAVES</span>, Samuel WHITESIDE, Nathaniel JOURNEY</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Amos SQUIRES</b>, giving an aggregate of 570 men.” </i>Two companies on this report:&nbsp;<b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Absolem </span>COX’S</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>William (WILLIS) HARGRAVE’S</b>&nbsp;were independent companies of the Illinois Militia.<span style="text-decoration:underline;">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><b>Attacks at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">THE NARROWS</span> </b>Following the relief army to Fort Harrison from Vincennes was a party of thirteen soldiers under <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lieutenant Fairbanks</span> of the U S Seventh Infantry escorting a supply wagon loaded with flour and meat. On <span style="text-decoration:underline;">September 13, 1812</span>, the supply wagon was ambushed by a&nbsp;<a title="Potawatomi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a>&nbsp;war party at a part of the trail known as The Narrows, (an area near modern&nbsp;<a title="Fairbanks, Indiana" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairbanks,_Indiana">Fairbanks, Indiana</a>), which had many ravines that serve as tributaries to Prairie Creek.&nbsp;When the ambush was launched, the draft horses panicked and ran away with the wagon. Only two men&nbsp;– the wagoner and one private managed to escape back to Fort Knox alive. Twelve soldiers and all the provisions were lost to the United States,&nbsp;and several Potawatomi warriors were killed or wounded<b>.</b></p>
<p>Two days later, unaware of the fate of the first column, a second column of two supply wagons and fifteen soldiers set out from Vincennes. When the Potawatomi learned that a second supply wagon was approaching, they set up the same ambush. On <span style="text-decoration:underline;">15 September</span>, after the initial attack, Richardson realized he was outmanned, and ordered a retreat leaving the wagons behind. A battalion under <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Major McGary</span> discovered the bodies a few days later, and proceeded to Fort Harrison to inform Colonel Russell of the attacks and&nbsp;– more importantly to the hungry survivors at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort Harrison</span>&nbsp;– to deliver the missing supply wagons.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">IN TRANSIT</span>: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Winchester</span>, meanwhile, departed Fort Wayne on September 22<sup>nd</sup> intending &nbsp;to recapture Fort Detroit when he received news that a hostile force was marching towards Fort Wayne. This force, under <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Major Adam Muir</span>, consisted of British Regulars, Canadian militia, and thousands of Native Americans.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Near&nbsp;</span><a title="Defiance, Ohio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defiance,_Ohio">Defiance, Ohio</a>, two <span style="text-decoration:underline;">scouting parties</span> met each other and the American scouting party was captured. The five men were marched partway back to the British camp before being killed. When their deaths were discovered, two separate parties of men were sent to retrieve the bodies. Both recovery parties suspected traps and retreated. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Winchester</span> finally sent a large contingent of militia who succeeded in retrieving the bodies of the dead scouts after a fight with the Indians. When <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Harrison</span> learned of the British Army marching towards Fort Wayne, he rushed to join <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Winchester</span>. The two armies combined forces October 2nd and the British withdrew to Canada.</p>
<p>THE SECOND TIPPECANOE CAMPAIGN: Following several defeats earlier in 1812, notably the Fort Dearborn massacre, a joint punitive campaign was sent to Illinois Territory under <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Major General Samuel Hopkins</span> (of the Kentucky Militia) and Colonel William Russell. Russell, coming from the siege of Fort Harrison, led a force of Illinois militia and Indiana Rangers and successfully destroyed a Kickapoo village on Peoria Lake. Afterward, he was forced to retreat to Cahokia when he could not locate Hopkins army. Hopkins, meanwhile could not get his Kentucky militia to engage and had been driven back to Vincennes when the Kickapoo started a prairie grass fire.</p>
<p>Major General Hopkins, humiliated by his loss, discharged the Kentucky militia under his command then set about raising a new army, which would consist of 3 regiments of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kentucky Infantry</span> commanded by Colonels Barbour, Miller and Wilcox, one small company of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">U S 7<sup>th</sup> Infantry</span> under Major Zachary Taylor, a troop of Indiana Rangers and a company of Scouts.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1<sup>st</sup> Regiment of Kentucky Mounted Riflemen</span> was organized on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">September 18, 1812</span> in Logan County Kentucky<i>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">SETH HARGRAVE</span>, (43 year old son of William and Elizabeth Miles) was appointed Lieutenant of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the 4<sup>th</sup> (Ewing’s) Company</span>. (Seth later filed a claim for back pay from September 18 through October 30, 1812.) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">JAMES E HARGRAVE</span> (22 year old son of Hezekiah and Susannah) also served with Ewing’s Company with the rank of private. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">JOHN ROBERT HARGRAVE</span>, (Seth’s oldest brother, age 57 in 1812 and a veteran of the Revolution) likewise served with Ewing’s Company with the rank of private.

When the army reached the original battle site, they found that some of the American dead from the first battle had been&nbsp;<a title="Exhumation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhumation">exhumed</a>&nbsp;and scalped. The bodies were reburied before the army proceeded to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">PROPHETSTOWN</span>, which it reached on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">November 19, 1912</span>. They found that Prophetstown had been partially rebuilt with an even larger Kickapoo village nearby.<sup> &nbsp;</sup>All residents and provisions had been evacuated as the army approached. The army burned the villages to the ground.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">While still in the area,</span> on November 21<sup>st</sup>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Colonel Russell</span> ordered scouts out to explore the area and to locate other villages. One scout, a man named Dunn, went up Wild Cat Creek and failed to return. The following day, on November 22<sup>nd</sup>, about 60 men under 3 captains set out to find him. Accounts vary slightly but, having spotted warriors in the distance, the troop went toward them only to find Dunn’s head either on a pike or on the ground. Close by, a mounted warrior waited tauntingly.</p>
<p>Thirteen Indiana Rangers lost their heads and took out after the warrior who, predictably, led them into a narrow canyon where Kickapoo, Winnebago and Shawnee warriors waited in ambush. With a few minutes twelve men and several horses were dead or dying. As nearly as I can understand what followed: one of the Captains followed, intending to bring the Rangers back into line. Instead, the remaining officers and men entered the fray, during which 16 more men died and several were wounded. The haste with which the survivors hastened to rejoin the main army inspired the sobriquet “Spur’s Defeat”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Other scouts returned</span> to report that a large number of warriors were gathering in the area. A reconnoiter ledGeneral Hopkins to conclude that “I have no doubt the Indians have taken the strongest ground I have ever seen. The deep, rapid creek was in the rear, running in a semi-circle and fronted by a bluff one hundred feet high, almost perpendicular, and could only be penetrated by three steep ravines.”&nbsp; The battle that might have ensued was prevented by the onset of bitter cold and snow. Ice was accumulating so rapidly on the river that Hopkins feared the boats would not be able to return. His report continued: “I had fully intended to spend one more week endeavoring to find the Indian camp but the shoeless, shirtless state of the troops now clad in the remnants of summer dress, a river full of ice and no certain point to which we could further direct our operations, under the influence and advice of every staff and field officer, orders were given and measures pursued for our return” to Vincennes.</p>
<p>Hopkins turned back, stopping at Fort Harrison to recover from the weather before proceeding to Vincennes. By the time they reached&nbsp;<a title="Forts of Vincennes, Indiana" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forts_of_Vincennes,_Indiana">Fort Knox</a>, two hundred men were suffering from sickness or&nbsp;<a title="Frostbite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite">frostbite</a>.</p>
<p>On December 18, 1812, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Major General Samuel Hopkins</span> announced his determination to retire from military life. While he apparently did not consider that his expedition had had been of any great value, the fact was that it did result in the Indians retreating northward. Prophet’s Town was abandoned and raids on settlers lessened. He died at age 66 on September 16, 1819 in Henderson County, Kentucky. He was a veteran of the Revolution as were many others leaders in the War of 1812.</p>

<p>Just before dawn on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">December 18</span>, an estimated 300 Indians counterattacked. When the shooting ended, 15 Miami and Delaware warriors lay dead and an untold number of wounded had been carried from the field. The two-day engagement had cost the lives of 12 federal troops with another 48 wounded. As many as 458 Indians may have died in the conflict. In the end result, Campbell’s half-starved troops marched in knee-deep snow for seven days on the return to Greenville, Ohio, resulting in 300 casualties from frostbite.</p>
<p>The Mississinewa Expedition was the most successful of Harrison’s military actions in the fall of 1812. It eliminated the Mississinewa River as a haven for Indian resistance, restored the people’s confidence in the army and secured the route of Harrison’s army for the recapture of Fort Detroit.</p>
<p>At the same time, their defeats at the&nbsp;<a title="Battle of Fort Harrison" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Harrison">Battle of Fort Harrison</a>&nbsp;and at Fort Wayne had caused many Native Americans to lose confidence in their chiefs. Many of them turned instead to the influential leadership of&nbsp;<a title="Tecumseh" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>&nbsp;and joined his confederacy. Interestingly, no major Indian attacks occurred in the&nbsp;<a title="Indiana Territory" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Territory">Indiana Territory</a>&nbsp;for the rest of the war.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Harrison</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> was in command. His first plan of action was to move north with the goal of retaking Detroit. To accomplish this, he divided the army. He would lead one column; </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Winchester</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> was to go on ahead leading the other but to remain within supporting distance to the west.</span></p>
<p>Winchester’s column, consisting of 2,000 untrained U S regulars and volunteers mostly from Kentucky, established a base camp at the Maumee River Rapids (present day Perrysburg, Ohio) about 30 miles south of Frenchtown.</p>
<p>Responding to requests of the citizens of Frenchtown and <i>ignoring Harrison’s orders</i> (presumably to stand by), Winchester sent a small relief detachment north to Frenchtown. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lieutenant Colonel William Lewis</span> led these men across the frozen Maumee River and along the coast of Lake Erie to the Raisin River. This detachment consisted of 667 Kentuckians and about 100 local French-speaking militiamen.</p>
<p>On January 18, 1813, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lt Col Lewis</span> led his men across the frozen River Raisin and attacked the British and Indian Camp which consisted of 63 soldiers of the Canadian Essex Militia and a 3-pounder cannon as well as about 200 Potawatomie warriors. A brisk battle took place before the Americans forced the British and their allies to retreat. The Canadians charged the American lines several times, supported by gunfire from the Indians. Fighting continued sporadically for several hours but, in the end, Lewis and his troops reclaimed Frenchtown.</p>
<p><i>Kentucky Rifleman William Atherton, writing about it later, described part of the battle as follows: “the fighting became very close and extremely hot… their method was to retreat rapidly until they were out of sight in the brushy woods and while we were advancing they were preparing another round of fire; so we were generally under the necessity of firing upon them as they were retreating.</i></p>
<p>General Winchester and 250 reinforcements joined Lt Col Lewis at Frenchtown on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">January 20</span>. When he departed the Maumee Rapids camp, he left word for Harrison explaining his actions; saying that “Nothing… but progressive actions” would encourage the mostly Kentucky volunteers as the following month their six month enlistments would be up. (Previous to Frenchtown, Winchester’s army had not seen any heavy action.)</p>
<div class="wordads-ad-wrapper wordads-ad-wrapper--inline"><div class="wordads-ad"><div class="wordads-ad-title">Advertisement</div><div class="wordads-ad-content" id="wordads-ad-441361" data-ad-height="250" data-ad-width="300"></div><div class="wordads-ad-controls"></div></div></div><p>Harrison, although pleased with the success of Lewis, feared that the British might overpower Winchester’s forces before additional troops could reach Frenchtown. Arriving at the Maumee Rapids the day Winchester left for Frenchtown, he immediately ordered additional troops to leave at once. Harrison, however, did not order Winchester to return to the Maumee Rapids. Instead, he sent&nbsp;Captain Nathaniel Hart&nbsp;to the River Raisin with a message “to hold the ground… at any rate”.</p>
<p>When Captain Hart arrived in Frenchtown, he found Winchester’s forces ill-prepared for a counterattack. Even after receiving reports from local residents that a large British force was headed toward the settlement, General Winchester maintained that it would be “some days” before the British “would be ready to do anything.&nbsp; The over-confident General spread his troops throughout the settlement and, without ensuring that sentries and pickets had been placed, went off to spend the night at an isolated home about a mile out of the settlement. He took with him the army’s extra black powder supply.</p>
<p>Winchester’s soldiers were largely untrained and inexperienced and the first battle of the River Raisin was the first combat most had seen. Ammunition and other necessary supplies had not been brought forward from the camp on the Maumee River. The palisade around the town had not been strengthened and the regular army troops were camped outside the walls.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, learning of the skirmish of Frenchtown, Colonel Henry Proctor,&nbsp;commander of the British forces in the area, organized a counter attack. Gathering troops from Fort Malden, consisting mostly of 597 British regulars from the 41<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Foot and local militiamen and 800 Indians led by the&nbsp;Wyandot Chiefs Roundhead&nbsp;and&nbsp;Walk-in-the-water and taking six small cannons, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Proctor</span> crossed the Detroit River and proceeded to Stony Creek, bringing his artillery with him over the ice. The British troops assembled the night of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">January 21<sup>st</sup>, 1813</span> only 5 miles north of Frenchtown, in readiness for the dawn attack. His total force numbered over a thousand, perhaps as many as 1,300 compared to Winchesters 934. &nbsp;Before sunrise on the morning of January 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1813, the British and Native forces attacked.</p>
<p>So began the<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> SECOND BATTLE OF THE RIVER RAISIN</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">: </span>The Americans took to their positions quickly and returned fire. Unfortunately, although guards had been posted, no one was guarding the road from the north.</p>
<p><i>A Canadian volunteer, John Richardson, later wrote, “On the 22<sup>nd</sup>, before daybreak, came within sight of the enemy…such was their security and negligence that… our line was actually half formed within musket shot of their defenses before they were even aware of our presence.”</i></p>
<p>The American regulars (those camped outside the gates) only stood for about twenty minutes. The four companies of regular infantry, consisting mostly of green recruits, were caught in the open and faced heavy musket volleys to their front while under direct round shot and canister fire from the 3-pound guns. Flanked by the Canadian militia and natives, they broke and ran. General Winchester, awakened by the roar of artillery fire, rushed to the battlefield and sent 240 men from the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1<sup>st</sup> Kentucky Rifle Regiment</span> to reinforce the regulars.</p>
<p>Under fire from 3 sides, the American troops fell into a headlong retreat toward Ohio. They attempted to rally three separate times but were eventually surrounded on a narrow road. Nearly 220 of the 400 had been killed, many of them, shot, tomahawked and scalped during the retreat. One hundred forty-seven men, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">including General Winchester</span> were captured. The Americans were scattered and not in any position to fight. Dozens tried to surrender and laid down their weapons only to be shot or tomahawked by the Indians. A few removed their shoes and ran through the snow in their stockings to leave footprints that looked like moccasins and thus managed to escape.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the 1<sup>st</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Kentucky Rifle Regiments</span> and the 1<sup>st</sup> Volunteers continued to hold in the town. At the cost of 5 killed and 47 wounded, they had killed or wounded all but 1 member of the gun crews manning the 3-pounders at the center of the British line and 13 of the 16 man howitzer crew as well as many of the attacking infantry, but, after repulsing three assaults, they were running out of ammunition.</p>
<div class="wordads-ad-wrapper wordads-ad-wrapper--inline"><div class="wordads-ad"><div class="wordads-ad-title">Advertisement</div><div class="wordads-ad-content" id="wordads-ad-981100" data-ad-height="250" data-ad-width="300"></div><div class="wordads-ad-controls"></div></div></div><p>General Proctor urged his prisoner, General Winchester, to order his remaining men to surrender unconditionally, otherwise they would all be killed and Frenchtown burned down. Winchester, who was in no condition to argue, offered counter-proposals which Proctor refused. Major George Madison, an American officer still on the battlefield, successfully persuaded Proctor to accept surrender with the condition that all would be protected as prisoners of war.</p>
<p>Seeing the British waving a white flag, the Kentucky Riflemen through it meant a call for a truce. Unfortunately, a British officer gave them an order to surrender from General Winchester. Refusing, they said they would rather fight to the death than trust the Indians. The fighting went on for another three hours before Major Madison issued a formal declaration of surrender.</p>
<p>The fighting ceased immediately although some of the Kentuckians argued with their officers, fearing that surrender would lead to their deaths anyway at the hands of their captors and stating they would rather die on the battlefield. At least 300 Americans were believed killed and another 500 taken prisoner.</p>
<p>The British Commander, overwhelmed with so many prisoners, and fearing a counterattack from Harrison’s command, moved quickly on the morning of January 23. The uninjured prisoners were marched north then across the frozen Detroit River to Fort Malden. The wounded prisoners unable to walk were left behind at Frenchtown. The intent was to bring in sleds to move them as well.</p>
<p>The Indians, however, had other ideas. They began robbing and pillaging the wounded Americans. Many were simply murdered. The buildings that housed the wounded were set on fire. Those who could escape the burning buildings were massacred as they tried to flee and those unable to move died in the fires. On the march to Fort Malden, those who were unable to keep up were butchered as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>An account from a survivor read: “The road was for miles strewed with the mangled bodies.”</i></p>
<p>Two weeks after the battle, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General James Winchester</span> reported that 547 of his men were taken as prisoners and that only 33 escaped the battlefield. Many of the prisoners were detained at Fort Malden until the end of the War over 2 years later. Winchester himself was detained for more than a year before being released. The rallying cry “Remember the Raisin” prompted many Kentuckians to enlist immediately.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">FORT MEIGS</span>: Absorbing the disastrous loss at Frenchtown, General Harrison descended the Maumee River with an army which would ultimately number 4,000, mainly militia, and began construction of a new fort on February 1, 1813. Located on the site of Winchester’s camp, it was named FORT MEIGS. The north face was protected by friendly Maumee Indian territory and the east and west faces by ravines. The south face was soon cleared of timber.&nbsp;<a href="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wood-county-oh1.png"><img data-attachment-id="1069" data-permalink="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/our-hargrave-family-and-the-war-of-1812/wood-county-oh-2/" data-orig-file="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wood-county-oh1.png" data-orig-size="180,196" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Wood County OH" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wood-county-oh1.png?w=180" data-large-file="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wood-county-oh1.png?w=180" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1069 alignright" src="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wood-county-oh1.png?w=108&amp;h=118" alt="Wood County OH" width="108" height="118" srcset="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wood-county-oh1.png?w=108&amp;h=118 108w, https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wood-county-oh1.png?w=138&amp;h=150 138w, https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wood-county-oh1.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px"></a><span style="color:#000000;">(Fort Meigs was located in present day Wood County, Ohio)</span></p>
<p>Once construction was under way,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Harrison</span> attempted a raid against the British position across frozen Lake Erie but, discovering that the ice was breaking up, he returned to the new fort only to discover that the officer in charge had departed with all his men because the enlistment period of the militia units had expired. Not only had construction halted but the wood that had already been cut was being used for firewood by those remaining.</p>
<p>As the enlistments of his own Ohio and Kentucky militia units were also about to expire, Harrison disbanded his force and departed for Cincinnati to raise a new army. He left <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Engineer Major Eleazer D Wood</span> to complete the construction of the fort. The remaining garrison consisted of several hundred men belonging to two U S Army regiments, plus militia from Pennsylvania and Virginia whose own enlistments were about to expire. From late January 1813 until the end of April, professional soldiers and militiamen, sick and well alike, worked in the cold, knee-deep mud and succeeded in completing construction just in time.</p>

He also persuaded Governor Isaac Shelby to call up a brigade of 1,200 Kentucky militia. The new brigade was formed under the command of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Brigadier General Green Clay</span> and had started for Fort Meigs but did not reach the fort in time.</p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers</span> mustered into Federal service on February 18, 1813 as the Regiment of Illinois Territory Militia. They mustered out and reverted to independent status on June 16, 1813.</i></p>
<p>The British force, consisting of 1,011 men and roughly 1,250 warriors led by Shawnee Chief <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tecumseh</span> and Wyandot chief <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Round Head</span>, disembarked at the mouth of the Maumee on April 26, 1813. His artillery consisted of two 24-pounder guns, 9 lighter guns and 2 gunboats with mounted 9-pounder guns. After several days of preparation, they began shelling the fort on May 1, 1813.</p>
<p>Back at Fort Meigs by May 2,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Harrison</span> sent a courier to General Clay ordering him to spike the British guns on the north bank and then to withdraw into the fort while Harrison himself would initiate a sortie from the fort to attack the battery on the south bank of the river.</p>
<p>The warriors set to guard the river had seemingly been inattentive which allowed the Kentuckians to gain complete surprise. Early on the morning of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">May 5, 1813</span>, a detachment from Clay’s brigade under&nbsp;<a title="Colonel William Dudley" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_William_Dudley">Colonel William Dudley</a>&nbsp;landed from boats on the north bank of the river. They stormed the batteries on the north bank and spiked the guns but used ramrods instead of handspikes, which meant that the cannon were only temporarily disabled.</p>
<p>Dudley then lost control of some of his men. Coming under fire from warriors in the woods, part of the Kentucky force pursued Tecumseh’s men, who succeeded in leading them deeper into the forest. Dudley followed in an attempt to bring them back, leaving Major James Shelby in command at the gun battery. The disorganized Kentuckians were cut to pieces in confused fighting against the warriors. &nbsp;Of Dudley’s 866 officers and men, only 150<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Fort_Meigs#cite_note-Gilpin187-14"><sup>]</sup></a>&nbsp;escaped to the fort. (Ergo “Dudley’s Massacre” or “Dudley’s Defeat”). The rest of General Clay’s force, which had not been involved in the attack on the British guns, had reached the fort safely..</p>
<p>On the south bank, the American sortie against the British battery was partially successful. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Colonel&nbsp;</span><a title="John Miller (Missouri politician)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Miller_(Missouri_politician)">John Miller</a>, at the head of 350 U S regulars and volunteers, captured the battery and took 41 prisoners. However, British <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Captain Richard Bullock</span>, with the flank companies of the 1/41st Foot, two companies of militia and 300 Indians, counterattacked and, in hard fighting, drove Miller’s detachment back toward the fort.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, British <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Major&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="Adam Muir (British Army officer)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Muir_(British_Army_officer)">Adam Muir</a></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&nbsp; </span>led three companies of the 41st Foot and one of Canadian militia from the British camp, stormed the captured battery, killed many of the Kentuckians and forced<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Shelby</span> to surrender.</p>
<p>The British artillery resumed fire that same day, but most of the warriors had abandoned the army and the Canadian militiamen were anxious to get back to their farms. The renewed bombardment had little effect and the garrison of the fort now outnumbered the besiegers. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Procter abandoned the siege and withdrew</span> on May 9, 1813.</p>
<p>After the battle, the prisoners from Dudley’s command were taken to the ruined Fort Miami near the British camp where warriors began killing the prisoners. Several died before <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tecumseh</span>, Lieutenant Colonel&nbsp;<a title="Matthew Elliott (loyalist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Elliott_(loyalist)">Matthew Elliott</a>&nbsp;and Captain <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Thomas McKee</span> of the&nbsp;<a title="Canadian Units of the War of 1812" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Units_of_the_War_of_1812#The_Indian_Department">Indian Department</a>&nbsp;persuaded the warriors to stop.<i> </i>Eye-witness accounts stated that between 12 and 14 prisoners were killed in the massacre</p>

You are unfit to command. Go and put on petticoats”.&nbsp;Another version of the incident had Tecumseh rebuking Procter with, “I conquer to save; you to kill”.</i></p>
<p>General Proctor tried to take <span style="text-decoration:underline;">FORT MEIGS</span> again In July 1813.They surrounded the fort for several days but without the proper vessels to bring in large guns by river, the effort was essentially dead on arrival. The British battery did have an effect, however, during that interval, conditions were so dangerous that the bodies of soldiers killed outside the fort could not be recovered; troops could not leave the fort to collect firewood and outbuildings were intentionally burned by the Americans to prevent them falling into enemy hands.</p>
<p>On <span style="text-decoration:underline;">August 1, 1813</span>, having failed to take Fort Meigs after two tries, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Proctor</span> moved on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">FORT STEPHENSON</span>, which guarded an American supply base on the Sandusky River (Ohio). <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Harrison</span>, who had only a small garrison of 160 U S Army Regulars at his command, believed the British force to be larger than it was. He ordered the commander of Fort Stephenson, <a href="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandusky-county-oh.png"><img data-attachment-id="1070" data-permalink="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/our-hargrave-family-and-the-war-of-1812/sandusky-county-oh/" data-orig-file="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandusky-county-oh.png" data-orig-size="180,196" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Sandusky County OH" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandusky-county-oh.png?w=180" data-large-file="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandusky-county-oh.png?w=180" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1070 alignright" src="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandusky-county-oh.png?w=108&amp;h=118" alt="Sandusky County OH" width="108" height="118" srcset="https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandusky-county-oh.png?w=108&amp;h=118 108w, https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandusky-county-oh.png?w=138&amp;h=150 138w, https://jeannehargrave.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandusky-county-oh.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Colonel George Croghan</span>, to destroy the fort and withdraw. Colonel Croghan insisted he could hold the fort. Harrison conceded but moved his small contingent 10 miles upstream to Fort Seneca.(Fort Stephenson was located in modern day&nbsp;<span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="color:#000000;">Sandusky County, Ohio)</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Proctor had no intention to conducting a siege at Fort Stephenson. The British artillery and gunboats did shell the fort but had little effect. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">On August 2</span>, he ordered an infantry assault. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Colonel Crogan</span> gave the order to hold fire until attackers were within close range, then gave the order to fire. (The attackers fell back and, although they tried repeatedly, they failed. Proctor finally realized the attacked could do very little against the fort and called off the attack. That evening under cover of darkness, Proctor withdrew his troops and retired to his boats leaving 96 killed and wounded behind him.</p>
<p>Young Colonel Croghan emerged a hero and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. Both Generals Proctor and Harrison, however, received substantial criticism. The British and Tecumseh were growing more and more aware of Proctor’s shortcomings as a leader. Harrison was criticized for not coming to the aid of the Fort’s defenders. Yet, in the end result, the British had been defeated and Procter did withdraw to&nbsp;<a title="Canada" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>. Fort Stephenson was the last of the western battles fought in United States Territory.</p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Details</span></i><i>: 1/The Indians stood back, offering no assistance to the British during this engagement and 2/The British believed George Croghan to have been only 19 years of age. He was actually 21 and a member of the family of General George Rogers Clark. </i><i></i></p>
<p>IN TRANSIT: Indian attacks continued in both the Illinois and Missouri Territories. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">By August 1813, </span>Governor <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Benjamin Howard</span> of Missouri resigned and took a commission as Brigadier General in command of the Rangers of both territories with Colonel<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Benjamin Stephenson</span> in command of the Illinois Militia. This army of nearly 1400 men departed Fort Russell, marched north along the Mississippi River with Stephenson commanding the militia units on the east side of the river and General Howard on the west. Near modern day Quincy, they took a large but deserted Sac camp, They then marched east to the Illinois River and made their way to Peoria. From Peoria, they proceeded north to Chief Gomo’s Pottawatomie village – also deserted. While no battles occurred during this long march, it did serve to scatter the Indians and forestall later attacks. Having established several small forts along the way, the entire army had returned to Fort Russell by late October 1813.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">THE THAMES CAMPAIGN</span> (Please note that, while descriptions of other actions are edited from several sources, I took the following account of the Battle of the Thames almost verbatim from About.com.)</p>
<div class="wordads-ad-wrapper wordads-ad-wrapper--inline"><div class="wordads-ad"><div class="wordads-ad-title">Advertisement</div><div class="wordads-ad-content" id="wordads-ad-489230" data-ad-height="250" data-ad-width="300"></div><div class="wordads-ad-controls"></div></div></div><p><i><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Barbour’s Company of the 10th Regiment of Kentucky Militia</span></i><i> was organized on August 31, 1813 for the Thames Campaign. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lt Colonel Phillip Barbour</span> commanded the regiment, with Majors James Gorin and John Barnett. A Private named <span style="text-decoration:underline;">WILLIAM HARGRAVE</span> was a member of that Company. I have no proof that he was OUR William M but given what we know about him in later life, it’s hard to believe he would not have been eager to go.</i></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Background</span>: Following the&nbsp;<a href="http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/warof1812/p/War-Of-1812-Siege-Of-Detroit.htm">fall of Detroit</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;in August 1812, American forces had been hampered in their attempts to recapture the settlement because British naval forces controlled Lake Erie. As a result, Major General William Henry Harrison’s Army of the Northwest was forced to remain on the defensive while the US Navy constructed a squadron at Presque Isle, PA.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">In August 1813</span>, the American squadron, commanded <span style="text-decoration:underline;">by </span><a href="http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/naval/p/War-Of-1812-Commodore-Oliver-Hazard-Perry.htm">Master Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry</a>&nbsp;emerged from Presque Isle. Outnumbered and out-gunned, British <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Commander Robert H. Barclay</span> withdrew his squadron to the British base at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Amherstburg</span> to await the completion of HMS&nbsp;<i>Detroit</i>&nbsp;(19 guns). Taking control of Lake Erie, Perry was able to cut off the British supply lines to Amherstburg. With the logistical situation worsening, Barclay sailed out to challenge Perry in September. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">On September 10, 1813</span>. The two clashed at the&nbsp;<a href="http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/navalbattles1800s/p/lakeerie.htm">Battle of Lake Erie</a>. After a bitter fought engagement, Perry captured the entire British squadron and sent a dispatch to Harrison stating, “We have met the enemy and they are ours.”</p>
<p>With control of the lake firmly in American hands, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Harrison</span> embarked the bulk of his infantry aboard Perry’s ships and sailed to recapture Detroit. Meanwhile, his mounted forces advanced along the lakeshore.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, At Amherstburg,<span style="text-decoration:underline;">General Proctor</span>, began planning to withdraw east to the western end of Lake Ontario. As part of his preparations, he quickly<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> abandoned Detroit</span> and nearby <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fort Malden</span>. Though these moves were opposed by Shawnee chief <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tecumseh</span>, Proctor proceeded as he was badly outnumbered and his supplies were dwindling. The retreat up the Thames River began on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">September 27</span>. As the march progressed, the morale of his forces fell and his officers became increasingly dissatisfied with his leadership.<b></b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison</span> landed his men and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">re-occupied Detroit</span> and Sandwich. After leaving garrisons at both locations, he began pursuit with a force of about 3,700 men. Pushing hard, the Americans began to catch up to the tired British and Indian force.</p>
<p>Reaching a location near Moraviantown (east of Detroit in present day Ontario) on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">October 4</span>, Proctor turned and prepared to meet Harrison’s approaching army. &nbsp;Deploying his 1,300 men, he placed his regulars and one cannon on the left along the Thames River while Tecumseh’s warriors were formed on the right with their flank anchored on a swamp. To extend his position,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> Tecumseh</span> lengthened his line into the large swamp and pushed it forward. This would allow it to strike the flank of any attacking force. The Indians were under command of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tecumseh</span> and his deputy, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Oshawahnah</span>, chief of the Chippewa. On hand for this battle were braves from the Shawnee, Ottawa, Delaware and Wyandot, as well as the Sac, Fox, Kickapoo, Winnebago Potawatomi and Creek tribes–some 500 in all.</p>
<p>Approaching the next day, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison’s</span> command consisted of elements of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">U S 27th Infantry Regiment</span> as well as a large corps of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kentucky volunteers</span> led by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Major General Isaac Shelby</span>. Shelby’s command consisted of five brigades of infantry as well as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Colonel Richard Mentor Johnson’s</span> 3rd Regiment of Kentucky Mounted Riflemen.</p>
<p>Nearing the enemy position, Harrison placed <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Colonel Johnson’s</span> mounted forces along the river with his infantry inland. Though he initially intended to launch an assault with his infantry, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison</span> changed his plan when he saw that the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">British 41st Foot</span> had deployed as skirmishers. Forming his infantry to cover his left flank from Indian attacks, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Harrison instructed Johnson</span> to attack the main enemy line.</p>

<p>Splitting his regiment into two battalions, Johnson planned to lead one against the Native Americans above the small swamp, Lieutenant Colonel James Johnson, led the other against the British below. Moving forward, the younger Johnson’s men charged down the river road with Colonel George Paull’s 27th Infantry in support.</p>
<p>Striking the British line, they quickly overwhelmed the defenders. In less than ten minutes of fighting, the Kentuckians and Paull’s regulars drove off the British and captured Proctor’s single cannon. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Proctor fled with his men</span>. To the north, Colonel <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Richard Johnson</span> attacked the Native American line. Led by a ‘forlorn hope’ (A band of combatants chosen to lead an assault on a defended position where the risk of casualties is high) of twenty men, the Kentuckians soon became engaged in bitter battle with Tecumseh’s warriors. Ordering his men to dismount, Johnson remained in the saddle urging his men forward. In the course of the fighting he was wounded five times. <i>As the fighting raged, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tecumseh was killed. </span></i>When Johnson’s horsemen bogged down, Shelby directed some of his infantry to advance to their aid. As the infantry came up, word of Tecumseh’s death spread and the Indian resistance collapsed. (<i>Wyandot chief Round Head was also killed in this battle.)</i><i> </i></p>
<p>Although the British feared that the Americans might follow up their victory and strike at their position at&nbsp;<a title="Burlington, Ontario" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Ontario">Burlington</a>&nbsp;at the western end of&nbsp;<a title="Lake Ontario" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ontario">Lake Ontario</a>, &nbsp;the period of enlistment of most of the militia troops in Harrison’s army was about to expire, and the Americans withdrew</p>
<p>Tecumseh’s death effectively ended the Indians’ alliance with the British in the Detroit region. American control of Lake Erie meant the British could no longer provide essential military supplies to them and they therefore dropped out of the war.</p>
<p>The victory at the Battle of the Thames saw American forces effectively take control of the Northwest frontier. With Tecumseh’s death, much of the Native American threat in the region was eliminated and Harrison was able to conclude truces with many of the tribes. Though a skilled and popular commander, Harrison resigned the following summer after disagreements with Secretary of War John Armstrong.</p>
<p>Although the Battle of the Thames essentially ended the struggle for the Northwest Frontier between the British and the Americans, and although Tecumseh’s dream of confederacy died with him, the Tribes continued the struggle independently. The year 1814 was a bloody one all along the line of the advancing frontier. The people of Illinois, with their extensive outlying settlements, suffered severely. Their militia units continued in active service.</p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WILLIS HARGRAVE</span></i><i> was promoted on March 12, 1814 from Captain to Major of the 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers.</i></p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration:underline;">His sons, SAMUEL</span></i><i> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">SETH</span> Hargrave served as Lieutenants of the 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Illinois Mounted Volunteers in 1814 under the command of their father. Their younger brother<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> GEORGE B </span>served as a Captain of the 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Illinois Militia in 1814. SETH also served with </i>Captain Daniel Boultinghouse’s company of mounted volunteers from Sept. 8 to Dec. 8, 1814.<i></i></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WILLIS</span> RESIGNED As Major of the 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Illinois Militia on August 12, 1817. He, along with his sons would return to arms in Black Hawk’s War in the early 1830s.</p>
<p>Peace formally came when the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Treat of Ghent</span> was signed on December 24, 1814. Over the next two years, the United States government re-established its military presence in the area by re-occupying posts at Chicago and Mackinac Island and by establishing new posts at Green Bay (Fort Howard) Prairie du Chien (Fort Crawford), Rock Island, Illinois (Fort Armstrong), Sault Ste Marie (Fort Brady), and at present-day Minneapolis-St Paul (Fort Snelling). Indian agents were also assigned to each military post with the task of acting as liaisons between the United States government and the Tribes.</p>

				<p>Mom, this was really fascinating.  You have such a way of digging well beneath the dates and names and making the stories of the individuals, and the battles in which they were engaged, come alive.  Thanks for this.</p>

				<p>hello, in your research, did you learn/see anything about En. Thomas Berry?  my direct ancestor, 5th great grandpa Thomas Berry (b. 1871 Washington co., va. , d. 1833/34 clay county, il.)  came to clay co., il. very soon after Illinois became a state, with his sons, daughters and cousins.  in our family papers we have a lamb skin warrant deed dated 1825 from the palistine land office near Lawrenceville, il.   but with the name Matthew Dockery on it, but  this land warrant has been in the family bible for looooong time.    there are several of my family surnames on your Hargrave’s Company list of mounted volunteers….I really hope I can figure out if Hargrave’s En. Thom. Berry is my ?? thom. Berry.<br>
thank you,<br>
Julie berry</p>

				<p>A great recount of the War of 1812! My ancestor, William W. Wheeler, served under Capt. Willis Hargrave and Capt. Phillip Trammell during the War. William was newly married and living in Union Co., KY when he enlisted in Capt. Hargrave’s Mounted Company of Volunteers, “called into service for the defence of the frontier of Illinois Territory against the late invasions of hostile Indians”. In 1822, William migrated across the river into Illinois, and settled in Wayne County, IL.</p>
