The family members recorded under the name **Adkisson** and its variants—**Atkinson**, **Adkinson**, and **Atkisson**—were foundational pioneers in the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands, particularly in **Lawrence County, Tennessee**, and **Madison County, Alabama**.

### **Sarah A. Adkisson (McDonald) and the Wayland Springs Line**

**Sarah A. Adkisson** (often recorded as **Adkinson** or **Atkisson**) is a primary figure in this lineage.

* **Birth and Parentage:** Born in **1835** in **Wayland Springs, Tennessee**, she was the daughter of **David Adkisson Jr.** and **Drusilla Bidsey Fooshie**. Her mother, Drusilla, was born in **Virginia** in 1798 and married David in **Roane County, Tennessee**, in 1816.
* **The Adkisson Plantation:** Sarah was reared on her father's plantation at **Wayland Springs**, where the Adkissons were among the earliest settlers. This plantation served as a geographic anchor for the family; after Sarah married **Thomas Anderson McDonald** on **June 24, 1852**, the couple remained at Wayland Springs for several years before moving to Wayne County and eventually **Cypress Creek** in Alabama.
* **Naming Variants:** In official marriage records, her name appears as **Adkisson**, **Atkisson**, and even **Adkipen** due to transcription errors. Her middle initial is occasionally recorded as "**P**".

### **The Atkinson Line of Madison County**

A distinct branch of the family used the **Atkinson** spelling and was prominent during the "Alabama Fever" migration into **Madison County**.

* **William Nathaniel Atkinson:** Born on **October 29, 1769**, in **North Carolina**, he married **Celia Elizabeth Prince** (b. 1778).
* **Malinda Atkinson:** Their daughter, **Malinda** (b. 1800 in Tennessee), married **Nathaniel Ananias Horton**. They were part of a closely intertwined network of families from the Edgefield District of South Carolina who settled in the **Meridianville** and **Hazel Green** areas.
* **Robert Howe Atkinson:** A later descendant in this broad network, born in **1957**, married **Julie Ann Spencer** in 1981.

### **Notable Relatives and Civic Roles**

The Adkissons and Atkinsons held various roles in frontier society, from skilled trades to church leadership:

* **David Atkison:** Identified as one of the original pioneers on **Shoal Creek** in Lawrence County before 1818.
* **D. H. Adkison:** Served as a trustee for a church built in **1859** in Lawrence County alongside other community leaders like William B. Hall and Ambrose Goodman.
* **Daniel Lafayette Adkisson:** A resident of **St. Joseph, Tennessee**, he married **Nora Lee McDonald** (the daughter of Fernanda Socrates "Bud" McDonald). They had no children.
* **James P. and Rachel E. Atkisson:** Residents of **Wayne County, Tennessee**, whose infant daughter died on **January 13, 1882**.

### **Genealogical Variants and Research Notes**

* **Surname Variants:** The sources demonstrate significant fluidity in spelling. For example, **Thomas A. McDonald**'s wife is listed as **Adkisson**, **Atkisson**, and **Adkinson** across various census and marriage indices.
* **Confusions:** While the name **Addison** appears frequently as a given name within related families (such as **John Addison Cobb** or **Joseph Addison Lewis**), it does not appear as a primary surname variant for the Adkisson family in these specific records, though it is noted as a potential point of confusion.
* **Other Early Records:** **David Adkisson**, **John Adkisson**, and **Neuton Adkisson** are all listed in early **Wayne County** records. **Benjamin Atkins**, a Revolutionary War veteran from **Laurens County, South Carolina**, is also noted as a kinsman to these lines.

ABSOLUM ADKISSON From Roots of Roane Co

 ABSOLUM ADKISSON From Roots of Roane County, TN, by Snyder E. Roberts, page 152 The Adkisson families on Emory River offer a number of genealogical puzles that need solving. The main problem relates to the various spellings of the name, such as: Adkisson, Atkinson, Adkinson, etc. Matt A. and his brother, William Adkisson, have been discussed in connection with their making the Great Seal. The names of these two, and David Atkinson appear on the Roane 1805 Tax List. Matt A. disappeared from Roane records about 1805. The problem is to separate those remaining. It appears that David Adkisson’s children are named in a deed dated 8 August 1810 when he bought 200 acres in Roane "for William , Caty (Adkison) Baskins, Mary Adkison, Joseph Adkison, Jesse Adkison, David Adkison (Jr), "Absolom" Adkison, Peter Adkison, Thomas Adkison, and Yerby Adkison." It appears that David was buying the land for his children Joseph, David Jr., and Absolom served in the War of 1812. The present discussion will be limited to the Absolom Adkisson family mainly based on information complied by Cynthia S. Cooper in 1900 and now in the possession of Mrs. Ted Cofer. ABSOLOM ADKISSON was born 3 March 1793 in VA. He married (1816) SARAH "Sally" ADKISSON (1801-1891). In 1830, Absolom is shown in Capt. Hassler’s militia company in the Swan Pond area, and paying taxes on 300 acres of land. By 1871, Absolom was paying taxes on three tracts for a total of 1296 acres. In 1880, he owned three tracts with 1051 acres; the largest one was bounded on the north by Dickey, on the south by Suddath, on the east by Hester heirs, and on the west by Emory River. Absolom was reputed to be physically large and powerful. Absolom and Sally Adkisson had 12 children as follows: Census 1850 Roane Co. Tn Head's of Family ADKISSON, Absalom, Family # 1534 ADKISSON, Morris, Family # 1566 ADKISSON, Walker W., Family # 1611

Married his sister Sarah "Sally" and had like a dozen kids.?

== Westward Migration Patterns ==

=== Overview ===

While the primary Adkisson/Atkinson lineages documented in "Roots of Roane County" remained established in Tennessee (particularly in Roane, Lawrence, and Grainger counties), genealogical research indicates that some family branches participated in the broader westward migration movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The scattered references to Adkisson/Atkinson family members in Oklahoma, Texas, and other western territories suggest multiple independent migration events rather than a single coordinated family movement.

=== Known Western Migrations ===

==== Oklahoma Territory ====

Several Adkisson/Atkinson descendants migrated to Oklahoma during the land rush period and early 20th century:

* **Marvin McDonald** (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) — Listed among McDonald family researchers in the 1970s-1980s, suggesting descendants of the Adkisson-McDonald connection settled in Oklahoma
* **Edna Pearl McDonald Henry** (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) — Also documented as residing in Oklahoma during the same period

The presence of multiple McDonald family members in Oklahoma City in the mid-20th century indicates that some branches of the Adkisson family (through marriage to the McDonalds) established themselves in Oklahoma.

==== Texas Settlement ====

* **Maggie McDonald Collins** (Rotan, Texas) — Another branch of the extended Adkisson-McDonald family documented in Texas, suggesting westward migration continued into the early-to-mid 20th century

==== North Carolina and Beyond ====

* **Arnold Edward "Bo" McDonald and wife, Polly** (China Grove, North Carolina) — While this represents an eastward movement, it demonstrates the geographic dispersal of the family network

=== "Going Native" — Family Integration in New Territories ===

The term "going native" in family history contexts typically refers to families who:

1. **Fully integrated into frontier communities** — Adopting local customs, occupations, and social structures
2. **Intermarried with local populations** — Creating new family connections in their adopted territories
3. **Changed occupations** — Shifting from the traditional trades (blacksmithing, gunsmithing) of their Tennessee origins to frontier occupations like ranching or farming
4. **Lost regular contact** — Becoming geographically and socially separated from the original Tennessee family networks

=== Occupational Transitions ===

The Adkisson family's primary trades in Tennessee were:
* Blacksmithing
* Gunsmithing
* Farming (particularly wheat farming in Lawrence County)
* Land ownership (substantial holdings documented in tax records)

Western territories would have offered opportunities for:
* Ranching and cattle operations
* Mining (in some regions)
* Homesteading
* Agricultural diversification

=== Research Gaps and Recommendations ===

The available sources do not provide detailed information about:

* Specific dates and routes of westward migration
* Names of Adkisson/Atkinson family members who settled in Oklahoma or Texas
* Marriage records or offspring from western settlements
* Whether any family members participated in the Oklahoma Land Run (1889) or later land distributions
* Connection points between Tennessee Adkissons and western settlers

**Recommended Research Strategies:**

* Search Oklahoma Historical Society records and land allotment rolls
* Review Texas county marriage and land records (Rotan, Fisher County area)
* Examine Oklahoma Territory census records (1890, 1900, 1910)
* Investigate McDonald family connections in Oklahoma City for Adkisson descendants
* Search for naturalization records if any family members were listed as "going native" in frontier territories
* Consult Fort Washita records and Indian Territory documentation for potential family connections

=== Connection to Broader Migration Patterns ===

The Adkisson family's partial westward migration mirrors broader patterns documented in American genealogy:

* **Post-Civil War Opportunities** — Many Tennessee families relocated westward following economic disruption and limited opportunities in the post-Reconstruction South
* **Family Chain Migration** — Initial settlers in Oklahoma or Texas likely encouraged relatives to follow, creating family clusters in new territories
* **Economic Transitions** — The shift from plantation-based agriculture and skilled trades in Tennessee to frontier economies in Oklahoma and Texas
* **Second and Third Generation Movements** — Children and grandchildren of the original Tennessee settlers may have migrated west, becoming fully integrated into western communities

=== Connection to the McDonald Family ===

The Adkisson family's westward movement is best documented through their marriage connections to the McDonald family. The McDonald family research notes specifically mention:

* Marvin McDonald (Oklahoma City) — Mid-20th century researcher
* Edna Pearl McDonald Henry (Oklahoma City) — Contemporary of Marvin McDonald
* Multiple references to family researchers in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas

Since Sarah A. Adkinson married Thomas Anderson McDonald in 1852, any Adkisson descendants who migrated westward would likely appear in McDonald family genealogies and church records.

=== Surname Variations in Western Records ===

Researchers should note that surname variations become even more pronounced in western territories:

* **Adkisson** — Primary spelling
* **Atkinson** — Common variant
* **Adkinson** — Variant spelling
* **Atkisson** — Less common variant
* **Addison** — Possible confusion with unrelated Addison surname

Census takers and record keepers in Oklahoma and Texas may have further corrupted these spellings, making it essential to search broadly and cross-reference multiple records.
