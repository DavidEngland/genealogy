=== Research Notes ===

'''Washington Connection:''' While family tradition often claims kinship to the Ball family of '''George Washington's mother''' (Mary Ball Washington of Lancaster County), genealogical research by Donna Rachal Mills [Lennon] in ''Some Southern Balls, from Valentine to Ferdinand and Beyond'' (1993) explicitly states there is '''no evidence''' to support a connection between Valentine Ball of Amherst County and the Balls of Lancaster County, Virginia.

'''Land Records:''' Valentine Ball maintained properties in multiple Virginia counties:
* Henrico County deeds (1750s)
* Amherst County deeds (1760s)
* Mortgaged 540 acres to Glasgow merchants (documented in estate records)

'''Occupational Records:''' 
* 1753: Payment records for "rolling and storing tobacco" from Westham to the Falls
* Multiple land transactions indicating substantial wealth
