			<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times;font-size: 10pt">Submitted by Mildred Gean Mason</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times">The following obituaries have been compiled and submitted in hopes that they may be of help to someone looking for family members. </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times">A large portion of these obituaries were taken from the clergyman’s records of Virgil Henderson Gean, Sr. He preached for over 62 years in north Alabama and southern Tennessee. His wife, Della V. Abilene Sego Gean, lovingly preserved all his records along with many obituaries that she collected from newspapers. </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times">Mrs. Gean’s sister, France Boyce Sego Williams, has shared her album of obituaries that she has collected, to be added to this work. </span></span> <span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: times new roman,times">Many of the obituaries came from the writer’s genealogy records of family members. </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times">Much care has been taken to copy each one as written and to give credit to the source. Some of them did not have which newspaper they came from on them. The writer tried to determine which newspaper the above people had access to, but sometimes it was hard to tell which newspaper should be listed as the source for the obituary. There may be some listed as coming from the Florence Times or TimesDaily that should have been listed as coming from The Florence Herald. There is also the possibly that some may have come from the East Lauderdale News. </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times">There were names that were misspelled in the newspapers, but were typed as written in the paper. Some of the dates were not listed for date of death, so cemetery records were used to determine those dates, if the cemetery was known. </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times">It is very possible that there are errors in typing. Sometimes some of the print from old newspapers was very hard to read. The writer asks for your forgiveness for any of those errors.</span></span> <span style="font-family: times new roman,times;font-size: 10pt">Submitted in memory of my parents, Virgil Henderson Gean, Sr. and Della V. Abilene Sego Gean.</span> ______________________________________________________________________________ <span style="font-family: times new roman,times;font-size: 12pt"><b>ABRAMSON, HENRY BENHART</b>, <i>Times Daily, Sunday, October 26, 1986</i></span> <span style="font-family: times new roman,times;font-size: 12pt"> “FLORENCE — The service for Henry Benhart Abramson, 75, Route 12, will be at 2:30 p.m. today at Wesley Chapel United Methodist Church, with the Rev.

He continued with this way of life in bringing up his own family off eight children.</span> <span style="font-family: times new roman,times">After becoming a Christian, Virgil felt that God had called him to preach. He was ordained by the Tennessee River Freewill Baptist association in 1940 and continued preaching for more than 62 years.

Later, he moved to Glenwood Rehabilitation and Convalescent Center, where he lived until his passing.</span> <span style="font-family: times new roman,times">Virgil farmed to make a living for his family, but his most important aim in life was to preach the word of God to as many people as he possibly could.

She was a resident of Bell county for 24 years and died here. She was the mother of six children, four boys and two girls of whom one was living with her when she died, Sarah Ann Perkins. Her youngest sons, Jesse Perkins, of Ft. Cable, Oklahoma, was with her when the end came. Her eldest son, Perry Perkins lives at Bell, Ala., and the other son, William Perkins at Cloverdale, Ala.</span> <span style="font-family: times new roman,times;font-size: 12pt">Mrs. Perkins was sick four months of tuberculosis. She bore her affliction with patience. She called on the Lord to come and meet her, also called on her granddaughter, Mary Perkins, to come and meet her. She was a member of the Church of Christ since 1895, coming into the church under the preaching of T.R. Burnett. She lived to see all of her children come into the church.</span> <span style="font-family: times new roman,times;font-size: 12pt">We hope this will be read by the many people who knew her. She was loved by all who knew her. She was Miss Martha Reeves before marriage and was the widow of H.F. Perkins, who died in 1894. The remains were laid to rest in Wilson Valley cemetery funeral services being conducted by Bro. Williams of Belton, Texas. Nothing has brought more sorrow to the writer, for she was a dear lover of mine and she will always be remembered by me for she was faithful to the end. Her dear daughter, who lived with her, is now left alone to mourn her death. She will always be loved and remembered by me. I am her loving friend.</span> <span style="font-family: times new roman,times;font-size: 12pt"> <i>Lina Smith”</i></span></p>

			<p align="center">1891 CENSUS<br>
WAYNE COUNTY, TENNESSEE</p>
<p align="center">By</p>

<p>The census records for 1890 were destroyed when a federal warehouse burned. In early 1891, probably because of this fire, the Tennessee legislature authorized a new census of the adult male citizens of Tennessee. The act was passed on Jan. 15, 1891 and approved on Jan. 28; the census occurred in February. In 1992, the original handwritten records were compiled, indexed, and published by Sue S. Reed of Houston, Texas as “Enumeration of male inhabitants of 21 years of age and upward, citizens of Tennessee on Jan. 1, 1891.” The State Archives in Nashville and a few public libraries in Tennessee have copies. One of the volumes includes records for Cheatham, Dickson, Hickman, Humphreys, Lawrence, Lewis, Perry (data missing), Wayne, and Williamson Counties.</p>
<p>The hand-written records for Wayne County have now been copied, transcribed as a computer file, and indexed. These data show name, age, color, and census district. Most entries include a family name plus a short form of a given name or one or two initials.</p>
<p>Federal census records show the order in which families were visited by the census taker, and families close to each other in the records usually lived near each other at the time of the census. This order is useful for genealogical research because families having the same last name and living in the same neighborhood usually have a common ancestry. Unfortunately, the hand-written records for six of the civil districts in the 1891 census of Wayne County were arranged alphabetically. Also race or color was not clear for some entries because of ditto marks below previously written letters in the columns for white (“W”) or colored (“C”); a few entries have ditto marks in both columns. On the transcript for this census, a “C” means that an African ancestry is clearly indicated on the handwritten record.</p>
<p>There are a few other problems with the census records for 1891. First, a total 2,290 names were certified by the Wayne County Court Clerk on Feb. 25, 1891, but there are 2,313 names in the surviving records; a few names were apparently added after the main group had been certified. In all of the civil districts, some names and ages are hard to read. Also, the spelling of some names is inconsistent, and some letters are not completely formed or distinct. If you find a mistake, please notify the historian’s office in the Wayne County Courthouse. Regardless of these problems, the 1891 records should proved useful for genealogy research.</p>

			<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">This file was prepared from a transcription of these records for Wayne County, Tennessee. The original transcription was done by Mrs. Nelle Jones Berry in 1985 and was published in “Wayne County, Tennessee Cemetery And Death Records” which was published jointly by the Wayne County Historical Society and The Byler Press. Input of these records was done by Mrs. Linda Davis Ledlow.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Should there be any question concerning a specific record and the information transcribed, please refer to the <strong>Original Certificate</strong> for clarification. Please do not contact Mrs. Ledlow or Mrs. Berry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">These records are found in the County Clerk’s office in the courthouse in Waynesboro, TN. The book is a large book, measuring approximately 12″x18″ in size, and about one-and-one-half inches thick. On the front cover is the title “Vital Statistics”. The first half of the book lists records of births between 1908 and 1912. The second half lists deaths for the same period. Only the records of deaths have been abstracted here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">This was used as a record book. The original certificates were sent to Nashville and are now on file at the State Library and Archives. A microfilm copy of both the records book in the clerk’s office and the original certificates from the Office of Vital Records is on file in the Wayne County Room at the Wayne County Public Library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Only the entries in the record book for 1908-1912 have been copied here. The original certificates for 1908-1912 have not been copied for this book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">Each entry in the book covers a line on two pages of the book. Only the right hand pages are numbered. The deaths are listed by a combination of Civil and School District for a two year period, i.e., 1908-09, 1909-10, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt">The headings at the top of each page are Name of Deceased, Date of Death, Sex, Color, Age, Married or Single, Place of Death, Cause of Death, lace of Birth, Occupation, Name of Physician Last in Attendance, Name of J.P. or Coroner Holding Inquest, and Date Recorded. Only the following have been abstracted: <strong>Name of Deceased, Date of Death, Sex, Color, Age, Place of Death and Place of Birth.</strong></span></p>

The cemetery is across the road from Piney Grove Free Will Baptist Church. George &amp; Nancy Vickery deeded the original one-acre of land for the cemetery and original church on September 13, 1909. Mr. John Weems deeded two more acres on March 18 1916. More land was deeded to the church later for parking and the cemetery as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">To reach the Melson Cemetery, travel Bear Creek Rd. (highway #203) west off Tennessee Highway #13. Bear Creek Rd. is south of Collinwood, Tennessee. Travel #203 for 5.2 miles to the Cromwell Crossroads community. Turn right at the Cromwell Crossroads Church onto Pea Ridge Road. This road will change to Rayburn Creek Rd. Travel 5.4 miles and after going down a steep hill turn left about 140 yards after crossing a bridge. This will be a dirt road. Travel .7 miles crossing a small wood bridge. Turn right at the Melson Cemetery sign. This road is also dirt and narrow. This enumerator suggests the use of a truck due to the road having ruts and very rough. There is a small stream to cross, however, this enumerator successfully made the journey in an automobile. Travel .4 miles after turning at the sign. There is one residence on this road and an attempt was made to ask about going there just as an act of simple courtesy, but no one answered. In all probability this road is on private property, so for courtesy’s sake, attempt to ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">This cemetery apparently has a decoration day sometime during the year and the grass is mowed. There are approximately 20 unknown graves in this cemetery.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">This is an updated enumeration prepared by the Lutts Extension Homemakers Club in 1987. <em>(The cemetery has been brought up to date as of 5 September 2007 by <a href="mailto:rwilbanks@tds.net">Reba Wilbanks</a>. New additions since the 1987 enumeration has been added at the end.)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Location: The cemetery is approximately 3/4 mile west of Lutts, high upon a hill overlooking the Weatherford Creek valley. The cemetery is on Tennessee Highway 203 and is to the south, boardering the highway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">This cemetery had its beginning in February 1877. The spot was selected and donated for a cemetery by James Hiram STRICKLIN when one of his sons died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">James W. “Jim” STRICKLIN, son of James Hiram and Nancy Caroline DANIEL STRICKLIN was the first person buried in the old part. Jim was born April 26, 1857 and died January 16, 1877.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">About 1947, the Lutts Community Club bought land off the same tract, at the time owned by Daniel WHITAKER, for cemetery use. This has been referred to as the “new part”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The first person buried in this section was John Marshall SINCLAIR who was buried January 3, 1952.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">In 1987, two new additions were added. The Franks addition came off the same tract of land as the rest of the cemetery. The Robbins addition came from the Joe ROBBINS farm just across the road from the present cemetery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The enumeration is done by sections: “New Part”, “Old Part”, and “Robbins Addition”. The enumeration is given row by row, grave by grave in each row.</span></p>
