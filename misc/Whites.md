The names and industries you recall are deeply embedded in the historical and economic development of the **Tennessee-Alabama borderlands**, particularly around the iron and timber hubs of **Iron City and Collinwood**.

### **The White Family Names: Harrison, Milton, and Jabez**
Your recollection of recurring names like **Harrison, Milton, and Jabez** is well-supported by the generational naming patterns found in the sources:
*   **Harrison White:** There were several men by this name. One was the brother of your 3rd-great-grandfather **John Calvin White Sr.**. Another was John Calvin’s son (a brother to Dempsey), who was born in 1790 and died in 1853. The **Harrison White** you remember selling Pontiacs would be a later descendant of this prolific line.
*   **Milton White:** This name appears in several branches. **Milton E. White** (born 1824) was a son of Dempsey E. White and Nancy Perkins. A later **Milton Pierce White** (born ~1880) was the son of Thomas M. and Susan Amanda White.
*   **Jabez White:** Your great-great-uncle **Jabes White** (born 1818) was the son of Dempsey White and Nancy Perkins. He was named for his maternal grandfather, the "Yankee" **Jabez Perkins**, who migrated from Connecticut.

### **Timber, Sawmills, and the Railroad**
While **Ervie White** is associated with raising wheat for **Gillis Mills**, your extended family was heavily involved in the **lumber and sawmill industry** that fueled the railroad expansion:
*   **Lumber Mills:** Your cousin **Mary Eudora "Dora" McDonald** was married to **George Forsythe**, who owned and operated a **planning mill and lumber company at Iron City, Tennessee**.
*   **Railroad Ties:** Your great-uncle **Jones Emory McDonald** was a successful businessman who specialized in manufacturing **cross ties for the railroads**, working as a timber buyer for the Florence Wagon Works.
*   **Collinwood Connection:** The sources note that the primary wealth of **Lawrence County** lay in its vast quantities of **walnut, oak, ash, and poplar timber**. The branch of the railroad ending in **Collinwood** was essential for extracting this timber to build and maintain the rail lines.

### **Iron City and the "Western Aristocracy"**
The iron ore you mentioned was the other half of the region's economic engine.
*   **Iron Ore Mines:** The sources confirm that **Iron City** was a center for **iron ore mines**.
*   **Family Investment:** Your ancestors' bachelor uncles, the **Emorys (or Embreys)**, were prosperous investors in an early railroad that linked the **Iron City mines to Florence**.
*   **Industrial Infrastructure:** Other kin, such as **William T. Rice** and **James Wright**, operated extensive **iron works and machine shops** near Florence, manufacturing ordnance and tools during the Civil War era.

By living and working at these **crossroads of industry**, your ancestors—from the **McDonald gunsmiths** and **Lewis brickmasons** to the **White wheat farmers and timber men**—provided the technical craftsmanship and resources that built the infrastructure of the Shoals.
