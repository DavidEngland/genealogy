Based on the sources, the relationship between the Whitley family and George Rogers Clark is established through marriage, though there is a slight clarification needed regarding the names provided in your query.

### **The Whitley-Clark Marriage Connection**
The sources confirm that **Esther Fullen Whitley** (the wife of William Chapman Whitley) was indeed the **sister-in-law** of a man named **George Clark**.

*   **The Link:** William Chapman Whitley’s sister, **Margaret Whitley** (abt. 1747–1831), married **George Clark**.
*   **The Frontier Journey:** In the spring of 1775, William Whitley was accompanied by his brother-in-law, **George Clark**, on his initial journey through the wilderness to Kentucky to select a location for their families. Margaret and George Clark eventually "settled out" in the Kentucky wilderness alongside the Whitleys.

### **Identifying "George Rogers Clark"**
While one primary source refers to the brother-in-law simply as **George Clark**, another specific document in the sources, **"The Hargrove Study,"** explicitly identifies this relative as the famous general:
*   The study states that Colonel William Whitley was a famous Indian fighter who, along with his "brother-in-law **General George Rogers Clark**," built **Crab Orchard Fort** (Whitley's Station) in Kentucky.
*   The sources further note that the Lewis and Clark families were connected to the famous explorers of the "Northwest Passage" (Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, who was the younger brother of George Rogers Clark).

### **Clarification of Names**
It is important to note a distinction in the names mentioned in your query based on the genealogical records in the sources:
*   **Esther Fullen:** This was the name of **William Chapman Whitley’s wife**.
*   **Elizabeth Barnett:** This was the name of **William Chapman Whitley’s mother** (the wife of Solomon Whitley Sr.), who emigrated with the family from Ireland.
*   Therefore, while **Esther (Fullen) Whitley** was the sister-in-law of George Clark, **Elizabeth (Barnett) Whitley** was his mother-in-law.

### **Summary of Relationship**
Through the marriage of **Margaret Whitley** to **George Clark**, Esther Whitley and the famous General George Rogers Clark (identified as the same George Clark in specific family studies within the sources) were members of the same extended family unit that formed the foundational "western aristocracy" of the Kentucky frontier.
