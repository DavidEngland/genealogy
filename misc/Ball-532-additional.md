The name **Valentine Ball** appears across three centuries of colonial and frontier history, representing a multi-generational legacy defined by land acquisition, military service, and strategic family alliances.

### **The Early Patriarchs**
The lineage began with **Valentine Ball (1616–1670)**, the son of Richard Ball, who migrated from London to the **Henrico settlement** in Virginia. His marriage to **Susannah Lewis** (born c. 1620) initiated a persistent genealogical link between the two families that endured for over 200 years.

The most prominent patriarch was his descendant, **Valentine Ball (1706–1770)**. Born in Middlesex County, Virginia, he was a hardworking landowner known for his precision in the delicate process of "rolling" and storing **tobacco leaves**. On January 31, 1733, he married **Susannah Lewis** (1717–1792) in Christ Church Parish. This union was a pivotal consolidation of family interests, linking the Ball line to the influential Lewis network.

In the 1760s, he transitioned from a Tidewater planter to a **colonial frontiersman**, moving his family to the rugged **Amherst County** wilderness. By 1770, he was a man of significant influence, witnessing land deeds alongside notable officers like **Captain James Dillard**. Upon his death in March 1770, his will provided for his wife and ten children, famously leaving **one shilling sterling** to most of his offspring—including **Mary Ball**, who married **John Washington Hargrove Sr.**—to legally protect the will from being contested.

### **The Revolutionary Soldier**
The next generation produced **Valentine Ball (c. 1755–1841)**, likely a grandson or nephew of the elder Valentine of Amherst. Residing in Chesterfield County, he served extensively in the **Virginia militia** during the American Revolution. His service included:
*   Guarding military stores at **Portsmouth** under Colonel Meredith.
*   Garrisoning **Williamsburg** under General Charles Scott.
*   Serving in a **"flying corps" of dragoons** to deter British incursions along the James and Appomattox rivers.

### **The "Valentine" Heritage**
The recurrence of the name served as a **cultural inheritance** and a **living pedigree**. It signaled a multi-generational commitment to the **"Christian soldier" archetype**—a blend of martial prowess and religious devotion highly valued on the dangerous frontier.

This heritage was carried forward into the Hargrove family through **Valentine Hargrove (1778–1858)**, the son of Mary Ball. Named to honor his maternal grandfather, he extended the family’s reach into **Kentucky and Tennessee**, where he earned the reputation of a **"good warrior"** during rescue missions into Cherokee territory. Ultimately, the "Valentine" name became a signature of stability and integrity as the family established permanent industrial settlements, such as **gristmills and sawmills**, along the **Alabama Shoals**.
