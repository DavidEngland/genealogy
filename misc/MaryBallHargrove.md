Father’s Estate and Will

Valentine Ball’s will (12 January 1769) provides insight into the structure of his frontier estate and confirms Mary’s married status by that date.

Primary Heirs and Major Bequests

• Susanna Ball (Wife): Received a life interest in the entire estate and served as Executrix, retaining control of the plantation during her lifetime.
• William Ball (Son): Inherited the land and plantation where Valentine lived, to be received after his mother’s death.
• Jane Ball (Daughter): Inherited all household goods, livestock (horses, cattle, sheep, hogs), and an enslaved man named Will, also after her mother’s death.


Nominal Bequests (One Shilling Sterling Each)

These symbolic bequests were standard legal practice to prevent future challenges to the will. Valentine left one shilling each to:

• James Ball
• Lewis Ball
• John Ball
• Alice Wright
• Sarah Bowman
• Susannah Heughs
• Elizabeth Heughs
• Mary Hargrove, explicitly identified as the wife of John Washington Hargrove, confirming her marriage before January 1769.


Executors and Witnesses

• Captain Henry Key, appointed Executor and given five shillings.
• Witnesses: Mary Key, Judith Tolley, and William Bishnell.

Marriage and Family

Mary married John Washington Hargrove Sr., Esq.  (ca. 1750–1838). Although no surviving marriage record has been located, her father’s will identifies her as “Mary Hargrove” on 12 January 1769, proving the marriage occurred before that date.

Geographic and Social Context

• Mary was born in Henrico County, but the Ball family relocated to Amherst County during the 1760s.
• John Washington Hargrove Sr. was active on the Virginia frontier and served as a Minuteman in Amherst County.
• The marriage likely occurred in either Henrico or Amherst County, consistent with the family’s movements.


Strategic Alliance

The marriage formed a significant Ball–Lewis–Hargrove alliance, linking established Tidewater families with rising frontier networks. This kinship structure supported the family’s later migration into Pulaski County, Kentucky, where Mary spent her final years.

John Washington Hargrove later served as a magistrate and migrated with the family from Amherst and Montgomery Counties, Virginia, to the Kentucky frontier.

Children

Mary and John Washington Hargrove had a large family, including at least five sons who became prominent in frontier communities:

• William Hargrove  (b. 1773): Captain in the Indiana Rangers; noted frontier fighter.
• John W. Hargrove Jr.  (b. 1775): Served sixteen years as sheriff of Claiborne County, Tennessee.
• James B. Hargrove  (b. ca. 1776).
• Valentine Hargrove  (b. ca. 1778): Named for Mary’s father; remembered as a “good warrior” who served with his uncle-in-law, Col. William Whitley.
• Lindsey Hargrove  (b. 1780).

Death

Mary Ball Hargrove died in 1813, likely in Pulaski County, Kentucky, where the family had settled.

Research Notes

• Marriage Record Gap: No formal marriage record has been found, but the 1769 will of Valentine Ball conclusively documents Mary’s married name as “Mary Hargrove.”
• Washington Connection: Family tradition often claims a link to George Washington through the Ball family. Current research shows no evidence connecting Valentine Ball to the Ball lineage of Washington’s mother. Any Washington connection is more plausibly through Lewis and Warner intermarriages.
• Birth Date Correction: Mary was born in 1749, not 1780. A birth in 1780 is incompatible with her father’s death in 1770 and the birth of her children beginning in 1773.
• Frontier Planter Culture: Valentine Ball’s will reflects typical eighteenth‑century Virginia inheritance patterns, with land and major chattels passing to sons or held by the widow for life, while daughters received nominal bequests or household goods.
