# Ruth Whitley Lewis

Ruth Whitley Lewis was the wife of Valentine Hargrove. Her father was Joseph Francis Lewis, and her grandfather was Joseph Lewis of Goochland who married Winney King. (This information was discovered recently in a microfilm rented from A.G.L.L., F3652 "Annals of Henrico Parish.")

## Family Connections

### Lewis Family
Ruth's father was the brother of Sarah Lewis who married Milner Redford. Their daughter married William Robards, and their son Lewis Robards married Rachel Donaldson, who later married President Andrew Jackson.

Ruth's father was also the brother of Colonel John Lewis who married Mildred Lewis. Mildred Lewis was named for her father's maternal grandmother, Mildred Reade Warner.

### Warner and Washington Connections
Mildred's father was Colonel Robert Lewis, who married Jane Meriwether. Colonel Robert Lewis's parents were John Lewis and Elizabeth Warner.

Elizabeth Warner's sister, Mildred Warner, married Augustine Washington. Augustine Washington's son Augustine married Mary Ball as his second wife, and they were the parents of George Washington.

### Heritage Records
The Reade, Washington, and Martiau families are documented in English heritage records, tracing back to King John and nine of the Barons who signed the Magna Carta. Their lineage goes from King John through William the Conqueror and Charlemagne.

### Kentucky Connection
Joseph Francis Lewis was shown in Kentucky in business with a King family member. Valentine and Ruth were named as legatees in a King estate (deeds are in the Sources section). Winney King was Ruth Whitley Lewis's grandmother.

Colonel William Whitley was Ruth's uncle and her mother's brother. He was a famous Indian fighter who, along with his friends Daniel Boone, John Hardgrove, and brother-in-law General George Rogers Clark, built Crab Orchard Fort in Kentucky. The Lewis and Clark families were connected to the discoverers of the "Northwest Passage."

# Benjamin Hargrave

## Fourth Generation
Son of Bray Hargrave and Mary Hodge Hargrave

**[4] BENJAMIN HARGRAVE** (Bray [3], Richard II [2], Richard I [1])

Benjamin Hargrave, son of Bray Hargrave, was born in Surry County, Virginia ca. 1693. He likely assisted his father on the various plantations as an overseer, and following his father's footsteps, became an overseer himself. Overseers were furnished a house and education for their children but were not always listed on tax or tithe lists. Many times they were counted simply as taxable male whites.

**Spouse [S]:** Unknown

### Descendants Uncertain

We have no definitive proof as to Benjamin's descendants, but early Hargrove records contain limited information. We believe there is significant evidence in a deed of sale from Augustine Hargrave (son of Bray) to Benjamin Hargrave (married to Lucy) for land on Terrapin Swamp. The deed states: "Whereon he now lives." Why would he live on that land (most probably inherited from Bray and Mary) unless he was a descendant of Bray?

Joseph Sr. had land at Terrapin Swamp that he inherited from his father Lemuel, who was also a son of Bray and Mary. Joseph later sold his land to Benjamin and Lucy. The father of Benjamin (who married Lucy) must have died before his own father, and since he was not the eldest son, his children did not inherit unless specifically named in their grandparents' will. Bray did not leave a will; Mary, his wife, was the administrator of his estate.

Both Bray and his wife had land. Mary inherited from her father John Hodges and was said to be a well-to-do young lady when Bray married her.

### Benjamin Hargrave b. ca. 1714

We find a Benjamin Hargrave born ca. 1714 in Surry County, Virginia who married Lucy and purchased land. He is the right age to be the son of Benjamin (son of Bray Hargrave). He bought land from Augustine, Benjamin's brother, located in the same area as other descendants of Bray—on the south side of Blackwater Swamp in an area known as Terrapin Swamp.

On March 17, 1760, he (Benj. b. 1714 married to Lucy) bought 114

# Research and Analysis

## Skeletal Structure of Hargrove Antecedents

The above chart has been researched and double-checked to form a skeletal structure for the antecedents of **John W. Hargrove Sr. Esq.** of Kentucky.

### Notes on Samuel Hargrove (b. 1667)

1. **Samuel Hargrove** b. 1667, found in the biographical chart of the Cooke family (shown in the front part of this book in the Richard II account). This shows Samuel married to Mary Cooke. It also shows Samuel Cornwell married to her sister Sarah Cooke.

### Notes on William Hargrove

**William Hargrove:** The revolutionary record of Hezekiah Hargrove in Nelson and Amherst Counties provided information that an old aunt had told him he was born in Caroline County in 1748. Our search naturally went to that county to try to find someone old enough to be his father. William was the only one we could find.

In 1744, William Hargrove, Eusebus Stone, William Eubanks, and George Penn all gave the sum of £50 sterling to be levied on their lands, tenements, goods, etc., in case they did not appear in Court in December to give evidence against Francis Barding, who had stolen 150–200 lbs of tobacco from Benjamin Hubbard's tobacco house.

### William Hargrove and the Hargrove/Hargrave Line

2. **William Hargrove** was found along with Bray Hargrove in King and Queen County, Virginia tax list 1734, showing 100 acres. He then appears on the tithe list of Caroline County in 1734 (part of King and Queen County was used to form Caroline County, Virginia—these appear to be the same man).

In 1739, we find on the tithe list in Caroline County: William and John Hargrove. They were both heads of household, showing John to be of age. Therefore, if he were 21 years old, he was born ca. 1718, giving a range of five years. This would place William's birth ca. 1689–1699.

We must find someone old enough to be William's father—he would have to be born before 1678. Bray Hargrove was born 1668 and died intestate. His wife Mary was executor of his estate. When Mary died, she left a will but did not name a William.

Bray had three half-brothers who were older:
- Richard III (whose son Richard IV migrated to North Carolina)
- John (whom we never traced beyond Surry County, Virginia)
- Samuel b. 1667 married Mary Cooke (daughter of William Cooke)

Sarah Cooke married Samuel Cornwell (brother of Lemuel Hargrave's wife Elizabeth Hargrave). Lemuel and Samuel were half-brothers, both sons of Richard II.

### William Hargrove, Overseer

3. **William b. 1699** became the overseer of Benjamin Hubbard's plantation. Many genealogists claim he had a son Samuel, who must have died early in life and left a widow Mary. This would account for the old aunt Hezekiah spoke of and also be the widow that married Leonard Tarrant in 1771, with William Loving as surety.

This explanation is detailed further in the following information under John W. Hargrove Sr. Esq.

**John W. Hargrove** b. 1720, married Beverly. This was a claim on the Revolutionary War papers of William Loving who married Elizabeth Beverly Hargrove (Elizabeth was given her mother's name). This makes Hezekiah, John, Samuel, and Elizabeth siblings.

### William Hargrove Court Records

- 1737: William Hargrove witnessed the will of John Eubanks (Caroline Order Book pg. 270, 1734/5)
- 1743: William Hargrove was indentured (leased and released) by John Arthur
- 1744: Listed as overseer of Benjamin Hubbard's Plantation
- 1770: William Hargrove Overseer died. Administrators were: Benjamin Hubbard, Chillion White, William Eubanks
- 1765: Amherst County, Virginia—William Hartgrave witnessed a deed (he would have to be 21 or older, born before 1744)
- 1777: William Hargrove died, and John Hargrove was the Executor

### John W. Hargrove Sr. Esq. Migration

**John W. Har(d)grove Sr. Esq.** b. ca. 1745, Caroline County, Virginia

In searching for the father of Valentine Har(d)grove, we found in Amherst County, Virginia a will of Valentine Ball in which one of the legatees was Mary Ball Hargrove. Valentine Ball had married Susannah Lewis, daughter of John Lewis and his wife Mary. They married in Middlesex County, Virginia in 1733. Mary was their sixth child and would have had to marry in 1768 to be named Mary Hargrove in her father's 1769 will. The will was made in 1769 and probated in 1770.

We knew Valentine Har(d)grove had a son named Samuel Ball Har(d)grove. In further searching, we found in the 1850 census record in Hardin County, Tennessee the following: "Living in the house of James Monroe Hargrove: Valentine Hargrove age 72, born in Virginia." James Monroe Hargrove was the son of Valentine Hargrove.

John W. Hargrove Sr. Esq. migrated from Amherst County, Virginia to Montgomery County, Virginia with his brother Benjamin Hargrove. Whether he migrated to Kentucky from there or whether the state's formation and subsequent county divisions affected the records is unclear.

### Hezekiah Hargrove and Revolutionary War

We show in the following account the relationship of Hezekiah Hargrove to John W. Hargrove Sr. Esq. The Revolutionary War records prove Hezekiah's age and place of birth. He was born in Caroline County, Virginia. All Caroline County records were burned, making the search very difficult.

We believe William Hargrove, overseer of Benjamin Hubbard's Plantation, was the son of Samuel (who married Mary Cooke). William was the name of Mary's father and the father of John and Hezekiah Hargrove.

### Beverly and Migration Patterns

Robert Beverly's first land grant was in Norfolk County, Virginia. He continued to accumulate land and finally settled in Caroline County, Virginia. Robert's grandson Harry had three children: Beverly, Sarah, and Elizabeth. Several Hargrave families migrated to Hanover and Caroline Counties around this time, coming from Elizabeth City, Henrico, Goochland, and Albemarle Counties.

### Repetitions in the Account

In the following account of John W. Hargrove Sr. Esq., there will be many repetitions of this information. This was necessary because there are two separate reports. The report given here on Samuel Hargrave, son of Richard II, is an accumulation of facts assembled with some proven facts to establish the most probable line of descent.

### Eubanks Family Connection

There is no doubt that the Eubanks family was closely associated with the Hargrave family. One of the Eubanks moved to Halifax County, North Carolina with William Thomas Hargrave when he sold his land in Hanover, Virginia (Caroline County) and migrated to North Carolina. Coincidence?

### Land Records

**Amherst County, Virginia, Book E, pg. 258–259, August 1, 1780**
Indenture: Martin King Jr. and wife Nancy (1st part) to Hezekiah Hargrove. Hargrove paid £100 for 306 acres on Rucker's Run.

### Valentine Hargrove and the King Family Connection

When Valentine Hargrove married Ruth Whitley Lewis, we found her father Joseph Francis Lewis was the son of Joseph Lewis of Goochland who married Winney King of Norfolk County, Virginia. Ruth's grandmother was a King. The Kings were found in Kentucky in business with Joseph Francis Lewis.

> *I have an uncle named Samuel King; his father's name was Samuel. Remember my grandfather I told about who gave me this interest in family history when I was around 7 years old? He told me names were the way families kept track of ancestors when they came to the colonies. He had an uncle named Samuel Ball Hargrove (Mary Ball—Valentine Ball's daughter).*

CHRISTOPHER HARGRAVE
Born ca. 1745 Lancaster, England Migrated to Maryland ca.
1770.Christopher Hargraves (Father unknown, uncle Abraham)
Christopher arrived after the American Revolution in Maryland
and married a widow Priscilla (Gibbs) Ward. Priscilla Ward
had three sons by her first marriage and had three more sons
after migrating to SC.
Christopher wanted to return to England and Priscilla refused
to go. Seeking legal advice in Charleston Priscilla
disappeared into Georgia with her six sons. Under the
Morman Internatuion index a John Christopher Hargraves was
found listed with his wife and their three sons, Abraham b.
1795 SC, John b. 1797 and Thomas b. 1799 in SC. Christopher
was not found on the 1800, 1810 federal Census for SC.
Christopher did return to England not to return and died
1820. Abraham did go to England in 1818 to help settle his
uncle Abraham's estate. Young Abraham did not return till
1824 to Georgia. Since English Law in the rights of
inheritance goes to the oldest son this probably left John
and Thomas (1) out of their father's estate.
The following family has been constructed with the Morman
Internation index.
[1] John Christopher Hargraves b. 1745 Lancaster, England,
died 1820 England. Married after 1790 to widow Priscilla
(Gage)Ward. [S] Priscilla (Gage) Ware, m. twice times;

Georgia in Ware Co. page 183, shows 1 female 15 under 20 and
2 males 20 under 30, and 1 male 30 under 40. The 1840 Census
for the same County on page 138 showed Abraham with 1 male, 2
females under 5, 1 female 5 under 10, If 20 under 30, and 1
male 30 under 40. The 1850 Census on page 101, dwelling 223,

f. A. Sidney Hargraves was found on the 1860 Census of Coffee
Co., GA in Abraham's household that was not shown on the 1850
Census. His age was given as 15
(1) "HNL" Vol 4 # 4, pages 132-34. Lois (Hargrove) Hardin,
Associate Editor, states that John & Thomas were twins, Since
the Morman Internation Index gives the birth years of all
three sons and the 1850 Census of Ware Co., GA shows b.ca.
1845 GA. that they were not twins. We accepted these two
references.

The 1860 Census of Ware Co., GA shows a Hiram Kitchen
age 2 GA, a Milly Pickett age 19, with a Thomas
Pickett age 6 months, probably Milly's son. From this
Census it shows probably that Milly was Abraham's
sister, widowed very young with her son. The Kitchen
name plays a very large part in other Hargroves of GA
in this time period.

ROBERT HARGROVE
( Son of Richard III and his 1st wife)
4. Robert Hargrove, Richard Hargrave III (3), Richard
Hargrave II (2), Richard Hargrave I.
Robert Hargrove was most probably the son of Richard III,
since we don't have the positive proof. We must prove by a
preponderance of information and evidence. Robert could have
been named after his wife's stepfather Robert Lacie. They of
Surry Co.,VA.
Robert could be the son Of Samuel, who was a son of Richard
II. Samuel lived in Surry Co., VA. and married Mary Cooke d/o
William Cooke Jr. born in Nansemond Co., VA., and later of
Surry Co., VA. Mary Cooke's stepfather was Robert Lacie.
Robert was b. ca 1700/1710 Lynhaven Parish, VA. He built the
Hargrave Tavern in Nansemond Co.. Va. This was a two storied
house with full basement which served as a store and Tavern.
It was here under the large trees in the yard that slaves
were bought and sold.
[S] Abigail Langley Granberry (widow) d/o Thomas Langley Sr.
Norfolk Co. VA. She had four brothers: Thomas, Lemuel,
John, and George, and onesister Mary Langley Millner.
(Norfolk Co. VA. Book H, pg. 215)
Abigail had six children by her first husband John
Granberry who died on Christmas day 1733, just three
months after their last child was born ( Bible records of
Suffolk and Nansemond Co. VA. by Fillmore Norfleet pg.
85) Abigail and John Granberry were married Feb. 1722/3.
Abigail and Robert Hargroves were married ca. 173 3/35
Abigail died 29 Feb. 1763.

On the 21 of Feb. 1749, Robert Hargroves bought 200 acres of
land in Edgecombe Co. NC. on the north side of the Tar
River joining Deep Creek ( Bk. 3. pg.491. Then 6 Feb. 1750
Robert Hargroves of Nansemond Co. VA. sold the same 200 acres
to George White Bk. 4, pg. 64) Edgecombe Co. was formerly
Bertie Co. NC. ROBERT AND ABIGAIL MOVED BACK TO NANSEMOND
CO.VA.
In 1767 Willis Hargroves was allowed a license to keep an
Ordinary in his dwelling house in Bertie Co NC. Two years
later in 1769 his license was renewed, but in June of that
year, Willis and his wife Elizabeth sold out to William
Granberry. (Probably Willis's half brother. ( Bertie Bk.L pg.
242) Willis sold some more land in Bertie Co. NC. in 1771,
then in May 1775, Willis sold land to James Swin Hargroves
(Bk. M. pg. 197) In Aug. that same year Willis of Nansemond
Co. VA. sold his Bertie Co. land to Gedion Harrell ( Bk. M.
pg. 250) IT IS PROBABLE THAT ELIZABETH IS THE D/O GEDION
HARRELL.
In the 1783 and 1790 Nansemond Co. VA. Tax List ( Captain
King's Co.) Willis the son of Robert and Abigail Hargroves,
was listed with five whites and eight blacks. Since this is
the only Hargroves listed in Nansemond Co. VA. it is
concluded that Willis' father and mother, Robert and Abigail,
had died previously and he was now responsible for the
household.
In the " Nansemond County Virginia Clerk
7
's Fee Book 1774,
Index." lists in 1791, Robert Hargroves (son of Willis)as
executor of Willis Hargroves will. This shows Robert Sr.had
died, indicates the number of sons in the 1790 census-tax
list and the given names of Hargroves in the 1810 census do
construct a family that was probably that of Willis and
Elizabeth. It is speculated from these data that they were
Josiah ( Estate)
Willis ( Probably migrated away later.)
James Swin (NC0,
Robert with son John
John Sr. with daughter Charlotte who never married,
son John Jr. ( married Ann) The Account book Ca. 1810-1840 of
Suffolk and Nansemond Co's. VA. by J.C. Calhoon. It contains
John Jr's estate records kept by Calhoon; 1834-1838. By using
this book plus " A record of farmes and Their Owners in Lower
Parish of Nansemond Co. VA." by Wm. Taylor Jordan, M.D.
1835- 1922 the family of John Jr and Ann Hargroves takes
form.
Following this report are two pages that are thought to be
Willis b. 1770 the son of Willis and grandson of Robert
Hargroves.
Richard IV was found on the tax list of Bertie Co NC in 1741
Robert would be the brother of Richard IV, shown by their
age.( Bertie Co NC. became Edgecombe Co. NC and Edgecombe
Co. became Granville Co. NC).
It is most probable that Richard Hargroves IVs, son John m.
twice and by his 1st wife had three sons, Steven, George and
Thomas. They were found on the Granville Co. (Hillsborough
district) census, on the same page with John and Richard V
This is the Little Nutbush area where Richard IV had
established his Estate and left to his two sons.
John was b.ca 1737 and he and Ann Newsome didn't marry until
1772, which indicates an earlier marriage. These boys were
not mentioned in John's will, seldom were the children of a
first marriage named in a will. He usually settled on them
before the will was maade out. This gave his new bride
assurance that her children by him would not be left out
because of the Primogeniture Law.
George the son of John by his 1st marriage, married Amelia
Harrell. Their son William named a son Richard. George named
a son Willis m. Rachel Cox. Willis Hargroves and Elizabeth
sold their land in Bertie Co. NC to a Gedion Harrell. The
original information sheet was sent by a decendant of Robert
and Abigail.

DUDLEY HARGROVE
pg 118 in Book
(Seventh Generation)
Son of William Thomas and Mary E. Dudley Hargrove.
[7] DUDLEY HARGROVE ( William Thomas (6), William Lane (5),
Augustine (4), Bray (3), Richard, II (2), Richard, I
(1).)
Dudley was b. ca. 1759/60 d. 1823 in Hanover Co., Va. He
moved to Halifax Co., NC. in 1761 with his parents when
he was 2 yrs old. He d. in Pickens Co., Al. 1 Oct. 1823.
Killed by a log falling on him as he was building his own
gin-house.
The first will probated in Pickens Co., Ala. was the nun-
cupative will of Dudley Hargrove. Daniel Jones Hargrove
took out letters of adm. on the estate. Wit's, to the
will were: Benjamin Persons, Willis James, Daniel Lowe.
The first printed record of Dudley Hargrove was in the
1790 census of Halifax Co., NC. pg. 64. 1 white male over
16 two white females over 16, two slaves. Then from the
tax digest of Hancock Georgia pg. 56. Dudley Hargrove 287
1/2 acres on Fork Creek, 12 slaves, 2 wheeled carriages.
(Tyler Quartely, Vol. 2 pg. 60 and Va. Quarterly vol.
24, pg. 305)
Land Grant Office, Raleigh, NC. "To Dudley Hargrove
warrant # 524, Halifax Co., NC. 49 acres issued Nov. 27,
1792. Entry # 222 entered Apr. 9, 1790 Book 78, pg. 514
from tract book of Pickens Co. Al. to Dudley Hargrove,
pg. 89, 291 acres pg 85, 168 acres.
Dudley Hargrove was an unlicenced Methodist Minister and
became a historic character in 1819 when he went from the
Tuscaloosa quarterly conference to the Tennessee
quarterly conference in Nashville. He was among others
that expected to be ordained as ministers but this
conference was pronounced in its stand against slavery
and these men were slave owners, so they were rejected.
In the Methodist records it is stated that all of
Dudley's children but Benjamin came to Pickens Co., Al.
from Ga. with him.
In 1761 William Hargrove purchased the 317 acres on Marsh
Swamp in Halifax, Ga. In the same area Dudley is of
record and has some dealings with his stepmother Sarah,
and his brother Dudley.
Dudley was 16 yrs old when his father died. On Aug 25,
1794 he purchased 91 acres from his stepmother Sarah for
69 pounds, with his brother William witnessing the deed.
Then on Oct. 4, 1796, Dudley purchased from William 165
acres for 165 pounds both purchases were for land on
Cade's Branch of Marsh Swamp.
Dudleys Marriage bond to marry Mary "Polly" Coleman is in
Greenville Co. Va. This census was not completed until
mid 1791 showing Dudley in Halifax Co. NC. with two
females. The two females were probably Mary his wife and
Susannah his mother-in-law, whose husband Col. Daniel
Coleman had died by 1787.
IN 1794 Dudley gave power of attorney to William Hargrove
to secure his legacy in the right of his wife in the
estate of her father Daniel Coleman deed.

BISHOP ROBERT KENNON HARGROVE
[Ninth Generation]
Son of Daniel Jones Hargrave and wife Lodocia Brantly
Hargrove
[9] BISHOP ROBERT KENNON HARGROVE (Daniel Jones (8), Dudley
(7), William Thomas (6), William Lane (5), Augustine (4),
Bray (3), Richard, II (2), Richard, I (1))
Son of Daniel Jones Hargrove b. In Gordo, Pickens Co.,
Al. Sept. 17, 1829. d. 1905.
[S] 1. Harriet Cornelia Scott, dau. of David Scott, m.
Nov. 11, 1852 in Tuscaloosa, Al.
2. Ruth Elizabeth Scariett June 20, 1895 in Kansas City
Missouri.
He was a graduate of the University of Al. where for four
years he was a professor of Math. He was elected Bishop
at the General Conference of Methodists at Nashville
TN. in 1882. He had served as President of the Centenary
Female Institute of Summerfi.eld, Al. and the female
college at Franklin TN. before being elected President of
Vanderbuilt University Board of Trust.
His Mother, Lodecia Brantley was a dau. of Thomas
Brantley. Thomas Brantley was a soldier under General
George Washington in the Revolution.
In Sept. of the year 1931 plans were made in Gordo Al.
to celebrate the birthday of Bishop Hargrove at the
HARGROVE METHODIST CHURCH, Pickens Co., Al., one of the
oldest Methodist churches in west Al. It was organized by
SAMUEL OR BENJAMIN ?
Samuel Hargrove and Bray Hargrove his half brother were b.
approximately 1 year apart. We have no will from either of
these men. We have no bible records, therefore for any
geneaologist to determine exactly how many children they had
or to which man they belonged is an ongoing search of the
records we do have. Many of the court records were destroyed
during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. The records were
burned some were stolen.
Benjamin Hargrave b. ca. 1690/3 and had Benjamin b. ca. 1714
that married Lucy could belong to either of these men. Bray
was b. 1668 m. ca. 1689. His son Benjamin was b. ca 1690/93.
Benjamin m. ca. 1714, married Lucy.Benjamin and Lucy had
John, Hinchey, Benjamin and Patience b. 1748.(Albemarle
Parish Records) Godparents: Benjamin and Elizabeth Clarke and
Elizabeth Vassar.
The Godparents of Patience, are of significance, it was John
and Mary Clarke that sold Bray his 1st acreage in Surry Co.,
VA., However it was Mary Vassar's husband Peter that Wit. the
1798 Will of William Cooke Jr. whose daughter Mary m. Samuel
Hargrave b. 1667. This is a tie in with both men.
When William Cooke Jr. died his wife Mary married Robert
Lacey. Robert Lacey died 1702 Surry Co., VA. Trustees to his
will were: Samuel Cornwell, Samuel Hargrave and John Weaver.
Samuel Cornwell married Sarah Cooke and Samuel Hargrave
married hherr sister Mary Cooke. (Surry Co., VA. Will and
Deeds Bk.5. pg. 246. 12 Mar.1701 ( Abstract)
Surry Co., Wills and Administrations, Bk. 7., pg., 140. 2
Nov. 1742. pg. 116 David Sebrell's Will written 7 Nov.
1742, probate 17 Nov. 1742.
Leg.: Brother in law Joseph Hancock
Sister': Suannah Hancock, Sarah Wilson.
Leaves land to nephew Nathaniel Sebrell on Terrapin Swamp,on
South Side of Black WAter Swamp. Stating it lay next to
Samuel Hargrave's place. Bk.8.( The land left to Nathaniel
Sebrell was sold to Augustine Hargrave, he left it to his son
Thomas when he died. Augustine's cousin Jesse married Naomi
Sebrell)
When Benjamin Hargrave that married Lucy made out his will
(Surry Co.,VA. " Will Book 1778-1782." pg. 192. 14 Oct.
1780. The Witnesses were Daniel and John Pond and Thomas
Hancock. ( These are names that tie in with Bray.)
In 1728 Bray Hargrove was given a land grant by William Gooch
Lieut. Gov. of 280 acres on the South Side of Blackwater
Swamp.
John Hargrove that married Judith Rogers in 1745, was born
ca. 1720. Have recently discovered they had a daughter
Mary who married John Bradley s/o Richard Bradley.
Godparents; Henry Bradley, Augustine Hargrove and Sarah
Carlile. ( Mary could be named for her mother and both men
married women named Mary.
In 1808 Barnwell Co., SC. Will of Mary Hargrove, names
Robert Bradley and Burrell Hargrove as her executors. Robert
Bradley became Sole Executor.
A part of Prince George , Isle of Wight and Surry Cos., were
taken to form Brunswick Co., VA. This is where Benjamin and
Rebecca Gwaltney Hargrave lived before they migrated to
Louisiana. The 1790, 1800 and most of the 1810 Census records
for VA. are missing.
Robert Hargroves, Nansemond Co., VA. could very easily be the
son of Samuel Hargrave that m. Mary Cooke. He could be named
after Robert Lacie, Mary's stepfather. He then would be
cousin to Richard IV. The only thing that made a more
positive statement was the fact that the information received
about Robert was made by Rev. Carney V. Hargroves of
Pholadelphia, PA. Mrs Francis Thompson of Hopeville VA. and
Mrs Anne Parker of Suffolk, VA> one of the several
grandcildren of Sallie Hargroves and Walter Jordan. Remember
Robert had only one child that grew to be an adult, that was
Willis b. 10 Nov 1741.
The research information about George Hargrove (son of John,
who was the son of Richard IV in NC.) was so thoroughly
authenticated with source material there was no question he
was the father of Willis Hargrove that married Rachel Cox.
Elsie Hargrove wife of Senator Richard Hargrove of Arkansas
did the research.
All of the above is information you should know in case
someone miraculously discovers some data that will give
positive proof of which brother was the parent.
