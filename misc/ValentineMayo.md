# Valentine Mayo (c.1665–1716)
## Middlesex County, Virginia

### Curator's Notes

Valentine Mayo was born c.1665, place unknown, and died in 1716 in Middlesex County, Virginia. His parentage is unproven. DNA testing proves that he was not related to William Mayo of Isle of Wight, Virginia. Many family researchers believe that he is the son of James Mayo and wife Mary, who settled in Isle of Wight. This is unlikely, as that James Mayo is too young to be Valentine's father. Many believe that his mother's maiden name was Valentine and that he was named for his mother's family.

Valentine appears in Virginia records beginning in the late 1600s. He was claimed as a headright for a William Clapham of Essex County. He witnessed a will in 1686, which helps to prove his date of birth. In 1702 he purchased 39 acres in Middlesex County.

Valentine married Ann Mickelborrough in 1710. She was the daughter of Edmund Mickelborrough and wife Elizabeth Minor. Ann had been married and widowed twice before she married Valentine. They had three known children. A fourth child, an infant who died before his first birthday, is sometimes attributed to this couple.

Valentine died in Middlesex County, Virginia, and was buried in Christ Church Parish. He left no will. His widow Ann was named administratrix of his estate. Documents still exist today for the inventory of his estate.

Many thanks to all the fellow researchers who added notes to this overview. I have left them intact below my notes. Those notes have been very helpful.

## Alternative Family Theory

Some researchers propose that Valentine Mayo's mother was Sarah Mayo, who married Jonathan Brooks. This theory suggests:

- **James Valentine** was born about 1610 in England and immigrated to Isle of Wight, Virginia about 1635
- He may be the father of Jane Valentine (born about 1637) who married Peter Ware, Jr. (they had Valentine Ware, born about 1660)
- Also possibly Mary Valentine (born about 1645) who married James Mayo (they had Valentine Mayo b.1666 Middlesex County, Virginia)
- The Mayo family is known to have emigrated from England to Isle of Wight County, to Middlesex County, Virginia to Caroline County, Virginia, to Spartanburg County, South Carolina

**Note:** Mary Valentine was born approximately 1652 and married James Mayo. They had a son, Valentine Mayo and at least one daughter, Sarah (Sarey) Mayo who married Jonathan Brooks, Sr. James Mayo (1650, Isle of Wight) was the son of William Mayo (abt 1630 of England) and Isobel Hardy.
