== Biography ==

'''Joseph Francis Lewis''' (c. 1750-1756 – c. 1825-1828) was a brickmason and early American settler who emigrated from England or Ireland to establish himself in Kentucky during the late 18th century. He is notable for his marriage into the prominent Whitley family and his skilled trade as one of the early brickmasons in the Kentucky frontier.

=== Early Life and Origins ===

Joseph Lewis was born between 1750 and 1756, likely in England or Ireland. Little is known of his early life before his arrival in America, though his skilled trade as a brickmason suggests he received formal training in his craft, possibly in the British Isles where bricklaying was a well-established profession.

By the late 1700s, Joseph had settled in **Rock Castle County, Kentucky** (now Rockcastle County), an area that was part of the early Kentucky frontier during a period of rapid settlement following the American Revolution.

=== Marriage and Family Connection to the Whitley Family ===

Joseph Lewis married '''[https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:SearchPerson&wpFirstName=Sarah&wpLastName=Whitley Sarah Whitley]''', sister of the legendary Kentucky pioneer and Indian fighter '''[https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Whitley-754 William Whitley]''' (c. 1749-1813). This marriage connected Joseph to one of Kentucky's most prominent early families.

==== The Whitley Connection ====

William Whitley, Joseph's brother-in-law, was a Revolutionary War veteran and renowned frontiersman who built the first brick house west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Known as the **"Sportsman's Hill"** or **Whitley House**, this structure was completed around 1787-1794 near present-day Stanford, Kentucky, and still stands today as a historic landmark. The house served as a fort during Indian conflicts and was a gathering place for early Kentucky settlers.

Given Joseph Lewis's profession as a skilled brickmason and his close family connection to William Whitley, it is quite possible that Joseph contributed his expertise to the construction of this historic brick house or other early brick structures in the region. The Whitley house was remarkable for its time, featuring:
* Brick construction in a region where most homes were log cabins
* Defensive features including thick walls and strategically placed windows
* Advanced architectural design for the frontier period

The Whitley family connection placed Joseph within a network of influential Kentucky pioneers, including other noted frontiersmen and early settlers of the Bluegrass region.

=== Trade and Occupation ===

Joseph Lewis was a **brickmason** by trade, a valuable and specialized skill on the Kentucky frontier where most construction consisted of log cabins. Brickmasons were essential craftsmen who:
* Required years of training and apprenticeship
* Possessed knowledge of mortar mixing, brick laying, and structural design
* Were among the more prosperous artisan class in early America
* Contributed to the permanence and development of frontier settlements

His skills would have been in high demand for constructing:
* Chimneys and fireplaces for log homes
* Brick houses for wealthy settlers
* Public buildings and churches
* Foundation work and other masonry projects

The presence of a skilled brickmason like Joseph Lewis in early Kentucky represents the transition from temporary frontier settlements to more permanent communities.

=== Military Service ===

Joseph Lewis served his adopted country during the **War of 1812** as a '''Private in the 7th Regiment, Kentucky Militia'''. This service came when Joseph would have been in his late 50s or early 60s, demonstrating his commitment to defending Kentucky during this conflict.

Earlier, in **1792**, Joseph had been appointed to the **Kentucky Militia** with the rank of '''Lieutenant Colonel''', indicating his standing in the community and his leadership capabilities. This appointment came during the formative years of Kentucky statehood (Kentucky was admitted to the Union in 1792), when militia service was both a civic duty and a necessity for frontier defense against Native American raids and other threats.

=== Children ===

Joseph and Sarah Whitley Lewis had '''eight children''':

1. '''Ruth Lewis''' 
2. '''Sarah Lewis'''
3. '''[https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lewis-9844 Isabella Lewis]''' 
4. '''Mary A. Lewis'''
5. '''Samuel Lewis''' – Married Mary Day; settled in St. Charles County, Missouri in 1816
6. '''Joseph Lewis Jr.''' – Settled in Palmyra, Missouri
7. '''William Lewis''' – Settled in Palmyra, Missouri
8. '''Benjamin Lewis''' – Settled in Palmyra, Missouri

==== The Missouri Migration ====

Several of Joseph's sons participated in the westward migration to Missouri in the early 19th century, continuing the family's pioneering tradition:

* '''Samuel Lewis''' (a brickmason like his father) moved to **St. Charles County, Missouri** in 1816 with his wife Mary Day, becoming an early settler of that region
* Joseph Jr., William, and Benjamin settled in **Palmyra, Missouri**

This westward movement was typical of second-generation frontier families seeking new opportunities as Kentucky became more settled and land prices increased.

=== Death and Legacy ===

Joseph Lewis died between 1825 and 1828, likely in the **Burkesville, Cumberland County, Kentucky** area, though the exact location and date remain uncertain. He would have been approximately 70-75 years old at the time of his death.

His legacy includes:
* Being part of the early settlement and development of Kentucky
* Contributing his skilled trade to the building of permanent structures on the frontier
* Establishing a family line that continued westward expansion into Missouri
* His connection to the historic Whitley family and their contributions to Kentucky history
* Military service during both the early statehood period and the War of 1812

=== Historical Context ===

Joseph Lewis lived during a transformative period in American history:
* The late Colonial period and American Revolution (his youth)
* The settlement of Kentucky and the frontier wars (1770s-1790s)
* Kentucky statehood (1792)
* The War of 1812
* The westward expansion into Missouri and beyond

As a skilled craftsman, he represented the artisan class that was essential to transforming frontier settlements into established communities. His work as a brickmason provided the literal foundation for permanent settlement in Kentucky.

=== Connection to Notable Families ===

Through his marriage to Sarah Whitley, Joseph Lewis became connected to several prominent early American families:

* '''The Whitley Family''' – Including William Whitley (the Indian fighter and builder of Kentucky's first brick house)
* '''The Lewis Family of Virginia''' – Possibly connected to other Lewis families who were prominent in Virginia and Kentucky
* '''Descendants''' – Through his son Samuel, connected to the Lewis families of Missouri

=== Research Notes ===

There is some uncertainty regarding certain details of Joseph's life:

* '''Birthplace''': Listed as England or Ireland; further research needed to determine specific location
* '''Birth Year''': Estimated between 1750-1756 based on age at death
* '''Death Location''': Possibly Burkesville, Cumberland County, Kentucky; requires verification
* '''Death Year''': Estimated between 1825-1828 based on available records
* '''Relationship to William Whitley's Brick House''': While family connection and Joseph's trade as brickmason suggest possible involvement, direct evidence is needed

=== Historical Sources ===

According to '''William S. Bryan and Robert Rose''' in "A History of the Pioneer Families of Missouri" (1876):

<blockquote>
"Joseph Lewis, of England, settled in Rock Castle County, KY., and he married Sarah Whitley, the sister of William Whitley, the noted Indian fighter. They had eight children: Ruth, Sarah, Isabella, Mary A., Samuel, Joseph, William and Benjamin. Samuel, who was a brick mason, married Mary Day, and settled in St. Charles County, in 1816."
