In the year 1777, known as the “year of the three sevens,” the lives of pioneers were marked by a tumultuous period of struggle. While on the refined Eastern seaboard, Thomas Gresham, a fifteen-year-old private in the Continental Army under General George Washington, endured the harsh winter of 1777–1778 at Valley Forge. Meanwhile, his kinsmen in the Kentucky frontier faced a different kind of “rebellion against the crown.”
In the Kentucky wilderness, February 25, 1777, brought a rare moment of joy with the birth of Levisa Whitley at Harrodsburg. Named after the region, she was believed to be the second white girl born in Kentucky. However, this domestic peace was short-lived. By May 1777, the “year of the three sevens” transformed into a time of constant siege as Boonesborough and Logan’s Fort (St. Asaph’s) were subjected to heavy attacks.
At Logan’s Fort, the garrison was precariously thin, comprising only fifteen men and a small group of women, including Esther Whitley and Margaret Clark. During a legendary encounter that summer, the fort faced a critical shortage of milk. The women ventured outside the picketing line to reach the cows. As they began milking, Native Americans opened fire, resulting in the deaths of two guards and injuries to others. Amidst the chaos, Esther Whitley famously paused to calmly retrieve her hat before retreating to the safety of the fort.
The violence of 1777 was further exacerbated by British interference from the north. In September, while six men were attempting to reinforce the small garrison at St. Asaph’s, they were ambushed by Native Americans who killed Ambrose Gresham. On his body, the attackers left a proclamation from Colonel Henry Hamilton, the British commander at Detroit (known as the “har’r buyer”), which promised a reward to any colonist who would desert the American cause.
By the fall of 1777, your ancestors had endured what many historians consider the most perilous year of the Western expansion. Figures such as James Duncan had fought through the entirety of the 1776 and 1777 Indian wars, while the Whitley and Gresham families remained confined to forts, eventually emerging to harvest the few acres of corn that had survived the torches of the Shawnee and Cherokee. This year of “three sevens” ultimately hardened the resolve of these pioneer families, solidifying their transition from temporary hunters into a permanent “western aristocracy.”
