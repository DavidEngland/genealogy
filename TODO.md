Based on the sources provided, there are several significant discrepancies and potential errors in traditional genealogical records that should be addressed to improve the accuracy of your family history.

### **1. The Gresham-Titsey Lineage Disconnect**
The most "glaring" error identified in the recent sources involves the long-standing tradition connecting the American Greshams to the **Titsey line** in England.
*   **The Error:** Older genealogies often identified the immigrants Edward and John Gresham as the "disowned sons" of **Sir Edward Gresham of Titsey**.
*   **The Correction:** Modern research and **Y-DNA evidence** (2022) prove this is incorrect. The US Gresham line belongs to **Haplogroup R-M269** (subgroup R-BY56690), whereas the Lincolnshire/Titsey Gresham line belongs to **Haplogroup I-M223**. These groups diverged thousands of years ago, meaning they are not related within a genealogical timeframe.
*   **Estate Evidence:** A **1657 lawsuit** over Sir Edward's estate in England lists his heirs but makes no mention of any sons living "across the seas" in America.

### **2. Thomas Gresham’s Parentage**
There is a conflict regarding the father of **Thomas Gresham (1761–1816)**, the first white settler of Lauderdale County.
*   **Traditional View:** Many trees list his father as **William Gresham** of Spotsylvania (son of Thomas, d. 1741).
*   **New Evidence:** Y-DNA results at FTDNA indicate that the three Gresham brothers who married the Thornton sisters (Thomas, George, and Benjamin) are **not connected** to that William. The updated records identify his parents as **George Gresham** (ca. 1740–1818) and **Elizabeth Watts**.

### **3. Philemon Gresham’s Death Date**
A specific conflict exists regarding the death of **Philemon Gresham** (Gresham-190).
*   **The Conflict:** One narrative states he died on **August 13 or 17, 1850**, citing the *Florence Gazette*. However, he is clearly listed as the **Head of Household in the 1850 Census**, which was conducted on **October 25, 1850**.
*   **Status:** This is flagged as a known error in the sources requiring further research to reconcile the dates.

### **4. John McDonald's Middle Initial and Migration**
The records for **John McDonald** (1792–c. 1860) contain unverified data points:
*   **The "W" Initial:** Some sources list him as "John W. McDonald," but family historians note they have **never been able to verify the "W"** in primary documents.
*   **Migration Timing:** One family note states he moved to Tennessee in 1792, but he was born that same year in South Carolina. The corrected timeline suggests the move from South Carolina to Tennessee occurred between **1816 and 1819**.

### **5. Whitley Family "Sons vs. Brothers"**
In the **Whitley lineage**, there is suspicion regarding the children of **Solomon Whitley** and **Elizabeth Barnett**.
*   **Discrepancy:** It is suspected that some individuals recorded as Solomon’s children, specifically the twins **Jonathan and Paul Whitley**, may actually have been **his brothers** rather than his sons.
*   **WCW's Testimony:** William Chapman Whitley reportedly stated he had **three brothers and five sisters**, which contradicts lists containing more children.

### **6. Clerical and Spelling Variations**
Researchers are cautioned about consistent clerical errors in primary sources that can look like "errors" in a GEDCOM if not noted:
*   **McDonald/McDaniel:** The McDonald family was frequently recorded as **"McDaniel"** in the 1850 and 1860 censuses for both Lauderdale County, AL, and Lawrence County, TN.
*   **Ingland/England:** The **Roberts Family Bible** specifically uses variant spellings such as **"Ingold"** and **"Ingland"** for the children of John England and Elizabeth Roberts.
*   **Lapon/Lawson:** **Rhoda Lapon**, wife of Matthew J. McDonald, may actually be **Rhoda Lawson**, as the double "S" in old script was often misread as a "P".
