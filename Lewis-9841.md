== Biography ==

'''Joseph Francis Lewis''' (WikiTree ID: [[Lewis-9841]]) (c. 1750-1756 – c. 1825-1828) was a brickmason and early American settler who emigrated from England or Ireland to establish himself in Kentucky during the late 18th century. He is notable for his marriage into the prominent Whitley family and his skilled trade as one of the early brickmasons in the Kentucky frontier.

=== Early Life and Origins ===

Joseph Lewis was born between 1750 and 1756, likely in England or Ireland. Little is known of his early life before his arrival in America, though his skilled trade as a brickmason suggests he received formal training in his craft, possibly in the British Isles where bricklaying was a well-established profession.

By the late 1700s, Joseph had settled in '''Rock Castle County, Kentucky''' (now Rockcastle County), an area that was part of the early Kentucky frontier during a period of rapid settlement following the American Revolution.

=== Marriage and Family Connection to the Whitley Family ===

Joseph Lewis married '''[[Whitley-753|Sarah Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-753]]), sister of the legendary Kentucky pioneer and Indian fighter '''[[Whitley-757|William Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-757]]) (c. 1749-1813). This marriage connected Joseph to one of Kentucky's most prominent early families.

==== The Whitley Connection ====

William Whitley, Joseph's brother-in-law, was a Revolutionary War veteran and renowned frontiersman who built the first brick house west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Known as the '''"Sportsman's Hill"''' or '''Whitley House''', this structure was completed around 1787-1794 near present-day Stanford, Kentucky, and still stands today as a historic landmark. The house served as a fort during Indian conflicts and was a gathering place for early Kentucky settlers.

According to researcher Larry Witt of Somerset, Kentucky, Joseph Francis Lewis built the William Whitley house, utilizing his skills as a brickmason to construct this historic structure for his brother-in-law. The Whitley house was remarkable for its time, featuring:

* Brick construction in a region where most homes were log cabins
* Defensive features including thick walls and strategically placed windows
* Advanced architectural design for the frontier period

Additionally, Larry Witt suggests that Joseph may have bricked '''Joseph Bledsoe's house at Creelsboro, Kentucky'''. The Bledsoe family were also prominent early Kentucky settlers, and such a project would be consistent with Joseph's profession and his connections to leading frontier families.

The Whitley family connection placed Joseph within a network of influential Kentucky pioneers, including other noted frontiersmen and early settlers of the Bluegrass region.

=== Trade and Occupation ===

Joseph Lewis was a '''brickmason''' by trade, a valuable and specialized skill on the Kentucky frontier where most construction consisted of log cabins. Brickmasons were essential craftsmen who:

* Required years of training and apprenticeship
* Possessed knowledge of mortar mixing, brick laying, and structural design
* Were among the more prosperous artisan class in early America
* Contributed to the permanence and development of frontier settlements

His skills would have been in high demand for constructing:

* Chimneys and fireplaces for log homes
* Brick houses for wealthy settlers
* Public buildings and churches
* Foundation work and other masonry projects
* Courthouses and government buildings
* Mills and commercial structures

The presence of a skilled brickmason like Joseph Lewis in early Kentucky represents the transition from temporary frontier settlements to more permanent communities. As one of the few trained brickmasons in the region during the late 1700s and early 1800s, Joseph likely worked on numerous important structures throughout central Kentucky, though specific records of individual projects have not survived.

Given his connection to the Whitley family and his position as a Lieutenant Colonel in the militia, Joseph would have moved in circles with Kentucky's leading citizens and likely contributed his skills to many of the region's early public and private buildings.

=== Military Service ===

Joseph Francis Lewis's military service in the Kentucky Militia spanned the early years of the state's founding through the War of 1812. In '''1792''', the year Kentucky was admitted to the Union, he was appointed to the Kentucky Militia with the rank of '''Lieutenant Colonel'''. This high rank during the formative years of statehood indicates his significant '''standing in the community''' and his leadership role in managing '''frontier defense''' during a period of rapid settlement following the American Revolution.

Decades later, Lewis demonstrated a continued commitment to his country by serving in the '''War of 1812'''. During this conflict, he served as a '''Private in the 7th Regiment, Kentucky Militia'''. His service as a private occurred when he was likely in his '''late 50s or early 60s''', illustrating a dedication to defense despite his advanced age.

This military record was part of a broader family legacy of frontier service; his brother-in-law, the legendary '''[[Whitley-757|William Chapman Whitley]]''', was a renowned Indian fighter and military leader, and his son-in-law, '''[[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]]''', also served in the militia during the War of 1812. Lewis's transition from a high-ranking officer in the early state militia to a private during the War of 1812 reflects the vital role the artisan class played in both the '''physical construction and the defense''' of the Kentucky frontier.

The rank of Lieutenant Colonel was a significant achievement, typically reserved for men of demonstrated leadership, organizational ability, and community standing. This high military rank suggests Joseph was a highly capable and respected individual who possessed not only skilled craftsmanship as a brickmason but also the intelligence and character necessary for military command. Such appointments were not given lightly on the frontier, where militia officers needed to inspire confidence and lead men in potentially life-threatening situations.

=== Children ===

Joseph and Sarah Whitley Lewis had '''eight children''':

1. '''[[Lewis-8883|Ruth Lewis]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Lewis-8883]])
2. '''Sarah Lewis'''
3. '''[[Lewis-9844|Isabella Lewis]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Lewis-9844]])
4. '''Mary A. Lewis'''
5. '''Samuel Lewis''' – Married Mary Day; settled in St. Charles County, Missouri in 1816
6. '''Joseph Lewis Jr.''' – Settled in Palmyra, Missouri
7. '''William Lewis''' – Settled in Palmyra, Missouri
8. '''Benjamin Lewis''' – Settled in Palmyra, Missouri

==== The Missouri Migration ====

Several of Joseph's sons participated in the westward migration to Missouri in the early 19th century, continuing the family's pioneering tradition:

* '''Samuel Lewis''' (a brickmason like his father) moved to '''St. Charles County, Missouri''' in 1816 with his wife Mary Day, becoming an early settler of that region
* Joseph Jr., William, and Benjamin settled in '''Palmyra, Missouri'''

This westward movement was typical of second-generation frontier families seeking new opportunities as Kentucky became more settled and land prices increased.

=== Death and Legacy ===

Joseph Lewis died between 1825 and 1828, likely in the '''Burkesville, Cumberland County, Kentucky''' area, though the exact location and date remain uncertain. He would have been approximately 70-75 years old at the time of his death.

His legacy includes:

* Being part of the early settlement and development of Kentucky
* Contributing his skilled trade to the building of permanent structures on the frontier
* Establishing a family line that continued westward expansion into Missouri
* His connection to the historic Whitley family and their contributions to Kentucky history
* Military service during both the early statehood period and the War of 1812

=== Historical Context ===

Joseph Lewis lived during a transformative period in American history:

* The late Colonial period and American Revolution (his youth)
* The settlement of Kentucky and the frontier wars (1770s-1790s)
* Kentucky statehood (1792)
* The War of 1812
* The westward expansion into Missouri and beyond

As a skilled craftsman, he represented the artisan class that was essential to transforming frontier settlements into established communities. His work as a brickmason provided the literal foundation for permanent settlement in Kentucky.

=== Connection to Notable Families ===

Through his marriage to Sarah Whitley, Joseph Lewis became connected to several prominent early American families:

* '''The Whitley Family''' – Including William Whitley (the Indian fighter and builder of Kentucky's first brick house)
* '''The Lewis Family Network''' – As a member of the Lewis family, Joseph would likely have been aware of his connections to other prominent Lewis families in Virginia and Kentucky. The Lewis name was well-established among the Virginia gentry and Kentucky pioneers. Given his social standing as a Lieutenant Colonel and skilled craftsman, Joseph almost certainly knew of and may have met other notable Lewis family members who were active in Kentucky and Virginia during this period. Family connections were crucial on the frontier, and the Lewis family network provided important social and economic ties.
* '''Descendants''' – Through his son Samuel, connected to the Lewis families of Missouri

=== Research Notes ===

There is some uncertainty regarding certain details of Joseph's life:

* '''Birthplace''': Listed as England or Ireland; further research needed to determine specific location
* '''Birth Year''': Estimated between 1750-1756 based on age at death
* '''Death Location''': Possibly Burkesville, Cumberland County, Kentucky; requires verification
* '''Death Year''': Estimated between 1825-1828 based on available records
* '''William Whitley's Brick House''': According to researcher Larry Witt (Somerset, KY), Joseph Francis Lewis built the William Whitley house
* '''Joseph Bledsoe's House at Creelsboro, KY''': Larry Witt suggests Joseph may have bricked this structure; further documentation needed
