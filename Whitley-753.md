== Biography ==

'''Sarah (Whitley) Lewis''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-753]]) (abt. 1752 – 21 April 1837) was part of the early settlement of the Kentucky frontier. Born in Augusta County, Virginia, she was the daughter of '''[[Whitley-754|Solomon Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-754]]) and '''[[Barnett-2252|Elizabeth Barnett]]''' and the sister of '''[[Whitley-757|William Chapman Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-757]]), the famed Kentucky pioneer credited with building the first brick house west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

=== Early Life and Marriage ===

Sarah married '''[[Lewis-9841|Joseph Francis Lewis]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Lewis-9841]]) on '''2 January 1779''' in '''Rock Castle, Rockbridge County, Virginia'''. Joseph was a skilled brickmason from England or Ireland. The couple later established their home in Rock Castle County (now Rockcastle County), Kentucky, placing Sarah within a network of influential Kentucky pioneers and frontiersmen of the Bluegrass region.

Sarah's siblings included '''[[Whitley-749|Margaret Whitley]]''', '''[[Whitley-752|Ruth (Whitley) Collier]]''', '''[[Whitley-757|William Chapman Whitley]]''', '''[[Whitley-750|Mary Whitley]]''', '''[[Whitley-748|James Whitley]]''', '''[[Whitley-755|Solomon Whitley Jr.]]''', '''[[Whitley-747|Catherine Whitley]]''', and '''[[Whitley-756|Thomas Whitley]]'''.
