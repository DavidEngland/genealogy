== Discrepancy ==

There is some confusion in Duncan genealogy regarding multiple individuals named Moses Duncan:
* [[Duncan-15062|Moses Duncan]] m Mary Ann Riley (son of Moses Duncan and Sarah Whitmore) – son of John Duncan and Jane Gray March
* [[Duncan-164|Moses Duncan]] m Sarah Tapley Clark (1806–1894) – son of Jonathan Duncan and Jane Jones

== Biography ==

'''Moses Duncan''' (1807–1868), often recorded as "Mose," was a prominent farmer and early settler in Lauderdale County, Alabama and the father of [[Duncan-3524|Martha E. Duncan]], who married [[Whitten-500|Jesse P. Whitten]].

=== Birth and Early Life ===

Moses Duncan was born in '''1807''' in '''South Carolina, United States''', continuing the family's Scottish heritage from Aberdeen. He was the son of '''Jonathan Duncan''' (age 40 at Moses's birth) and '''Jane Jones''' (age 32 at Moses's birth), who were part of the Duncan family that migrated from South Carolina to Tennessee and Alabama in the early 19th century.

He is present in Lauderdale County, Alabama records by the 1830 census and appears consistently through 1860, reflecting his move into the Shoals region during the early frontier period. He worked as a successful agriculturalist and plantation owner, and he is enumerated in both the 1850 and 1860 slave schedules.

His father Jonathan Duncan had a will dated 23 Oct 1804, and by about 1819, Jonathan moved to Warren County, Tennessee, then to Lauderdale County, Alabama around 1822.<ref>"John Duncan of Aberdeen" by Stuart C. Duncan, pg 105</ref>

=== Marriage ===

On '''27 March 1829''', Moses married '''Sarah Tapley Clark''' (often recorded as "Sally" or "Aunt Sallie") in Lauderdale, Alabama, United States.<ref name="marriage">"Alabama County Marriages, 1711-1992," database with images, FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q2DQ-TKGX : accessed 22 August 2025), Mose Duncan and Sally Clark, 27 Mar 1829; citing Lauderdale, Alabama, United States.</ref>

'''Sarah Tapley Clark Duncan''' (23 Feb 1806 – 6 Jun 1894) was the daughter of '''Robert Clark''' (age 28 at her birth) and '''Lucy Farmer''' (age 22 at her birth). She was born in Giles, Tennessee and died in Lauderdale, Alabama at the age of 88 years.

=== Death and Burial ===

Moses Duncan died on '''20 May 1868''' in Lauderdale, Alabama, United States, at the age of '''61 years'''. Family accounts and cemetery transcriptions place his burial with Sarah on a small knoll at the center of '''Duncan Cemetery''' where the road splits around the eye shaped plot.  The memorial is documented at [Find a Grave memorial](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/39847217/moses-duncan).

According to Find a Grave cemetery records from the Duncan burial grounds, Moses Duncan's memorial shows:
* '''Birth Year:''' 1807
* '''Death Year:''' 1868
* '''Status:''' Flowers have been left on his grave

=== Name Variations and the "Maps" Tradition ===

Local oral history sometimes records the name "Maps," likely a phonetic or clerical rendering of other Duncan women. Early Newberry County, South Carolina deeds show a woman named '''March Duncan''' (made her "X" mark) witnessing an 1805 transaction on Duncans Creek involving John and James Duncan, and an earlier 1787 deed was witnessed by a woman recorded as '''Molen (Moler) Duncan'''—occasionally misread as "Moses"—whose name may have evolved in family tradition.

=== Family Legacy ===

Family tradition traces Moses back to [[Duncan-166|John Duncan (The Elder)]] (c.1720–c.1805) of Aberdeen, Scotland, who settled Duncan's Creek in the Newberry District of South Carolina, with the line moving through South Carolina into Tennessee and Alabama. A later generation reportedly includes granddaughter Amber Rose Duncan marrying George William Gresham, intertwining the Duncan, Gresham, and Larimore families of the Mars Hill community.
