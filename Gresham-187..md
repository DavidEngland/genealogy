: In 1776 at age 15, Thomas enlisted in the Continental Army and served as a pvt in [http://valleyforgemusterroll.org/muster.asp?id=VA13846 Capt Rob't Powell's Co, 3rd VA Regt], commanded by [[Marshall-229|Col Thomas Marshall]] and Lt Col Wm Heth. He was at Valley Forge in the winter 1777-1778 under [[Washington-11|Gen George Washington]]. Was discharged Feb 14, 1778 (records show that he was in the hospital at the time).  He received a grant of land in KY for his service.

: Around 1800 he started to KY to claim his land, but the Indians were so hostile that he stopped in Lawrence Co, TN. Went to AL prior to 1814, but again the Indians drove him into TN. (Note: The army removed settlers from Doublehead's reservation during this time....most came back and rebuilt after the army left.) Came back to AL in 1816 and got some 160 A of land (granted to him by Congress), probably along Blue Water Creek, Lauderdale Co, AL.

: Both he and Mary are buried in Gresham Cemetery on Blue Water Creek near Green Hill (Greenhill, Lauderdale County, AL) The surname on the headstone is spelled '''Grisham''' for both him and his wife.  Many rebels during the Revolutionary war changed the spelling to distinguish themselves from the Loyalist (Torries).

: Thomas Gresham was a signer of the Doublehead petition against the removal of white settlers from lands of Doublehead Reserve, the date taken was not given, however the date it was received in Washington DC was December 1810. The locale of these petitioners seems to have been in present Lauderdale Co. Alabama.

: Thomas is considered the first white settler in Lauderdale County. The area he and his wife settled is along Bluewater Creek between Greenhill and Lexington, Alabama and near the TN state line. He is listed in the 1811 census of the Alabama Territory as living on Indian Land.

=== Note ===
*Note:  Thomas Gresham's birthdate is questionable and he has not been definitely proven to be a child of George Gresham and Elizabeth Watts. From information from Bobby G. Lane, he served in Rev. War.  I'm wondering if this is the Thomas Gresham who married a Thornton girl and ended up in present day Lauderdale County, AL where he died in 1816. See Gresham Any Way You Spell It by Virgil Gresham.

*NOTE: Some old genealogies list William Gresham of Spotsylvania/Amherst/Halifax (son of Thomas d. 1741 and Mary Gresham of the Deed of Gift in 1742) as the father of the three Gresham men who married three Thornton sisters but Ydna results at FTDNA are not indicating this result Dna is showing that the three Gresham men who married Thornton sisters are not connected to this William, son of Thomas d. 1741 See FTDNA Big Y Matches in the Grissom, Gresham, Grisham Surname Study. Gresham-1033

*If you are a Gresham male in this line, please consider doing a YDNA test at FTDNA at 111 markers and then joining the Big Y Gresham Surname Project. Progress is being made on unraveling these old Virginia lines, but your participation would be so valuable now and for future researchers. Gresham-1033
