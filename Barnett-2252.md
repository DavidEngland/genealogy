'''Elizabeth Barnett''' was born around 1723 in Northern Ireland. She married '''Solomon Whitley''' (also spelled Whitely) in Ireland before 1745. Seeking to escape religious persecution, Elizabeth and Solomon emigrated from Ireland to America, where they would become pioneers of the American frontier.

=== Settlement and Migration ===

Elizabeth and Solomon initially settled in '''Augusta County''', Virginia (specifically in the portion later incorporated into Rockbridge County). Most of their children were born in this region. Around 1782, as the Kentucky frontier opened, Elizabeth and Solomon joined their children in moving west, eventually settling at '''Whitley's Station''' (also known as Walnut Flat or Walnut Creek) in Lincoln County, Kentucky.

=== Family and Legacy ===

Elizabeth and Solomon raised a large family that became foundational to early American frontier settlement. Their documented children include:

* '''[[Whitley|William Chapman Whitley]] (b. 1749):''' The eldest son and a legendary Kentucky frontiersman
* '''[[Whitley|Margaret Whitley]] (abt. 1747–1831):''' Married George Clark; traveled to Kentucky with her brother William
* '''[[Whitley|Sarah Whitley]] (abt. 1752–1837):''' Married brickmason [[Lewis|Joseph Francis Lewis]]
* '''[[Collier|Ruth (Whitley) Collier]] (abt. 1748–1789):''' Married Moses Collier; her descendants include Union General [[Rawlins|John Aaron Rawlins]]
* '''Other children:''' Mary, James (a Baptist minister), Solomon Jr., Catherine, and Thomas

=== Domestic Life ===

Elizabeth's household was deeply rooted in the Presbyterian faith. Her husband was known for teaching their children and grandchildren the old Presbyterian Catechism. Elizabeth died approximately 1782 or 1783, shortly after her husband, at Whitley's Station in Lincoln County, Kentucky.
