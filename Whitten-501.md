== Biography ==

'''Mary Ann Whitten''' was born on July 1, 1836, likely in Lauderdale County, Alabama or Wayne County, Tennessee.<ref name="death1934">Alabama Deaths, 1908-1974," database, FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JDYN-6XN : accessed 10 October 2013), Polly Ann Whitten in entry for Sue Lovelace, 1934.</ref> She was the daughter of Jesse P. Whitten or possibly Jonathan Whitten (see Research Notes below).

=== Marriage to William George Gresham ===

Mary Ann married [[Gresham-184|William George Gresham]] (March 8, 1836 – 1923) around 1865, shortly after his return from Confederate service in the Civil War.<ref>Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresham'', 1976-1977.</ref> This marriage represented a significant spiritual partnership, as William transformed from a Confederate quartermaster into a prominent circuit-riding minister in the Church of Christ.

Mary Ann and William were the parents of five children:

1. [[Gresham-182|Mollie Leona Gresham]] (September 21, 1874 – January 24, 1953)<ref name="death1953">"Alabama Deaths, 1908-1974," database, FamilySearch (accessed 2 April 2014), Polly Whitten in entry for Mollie L. Parrish, 1953.</ref>
   * Married [[Parish-XXX|William Archabald Parish (Esq.)]] on January 15, 1890
   * Mother of [[Parish-370|Nancy Pearl Parish]] who married [[England-1360|William Edward "Ed" England]]

2. Alice J. Gresham (birth date unknown)

3. Margaret "Maggie" Gresham (birth date unknown)

4. Sue Gresham (birth date unknown)<ref name="death1934"/>

5. Unnamed son (died in infancy)

=== Life as a Minister's Wife ===

As the wife of a circuit-riding Church of Christ minister, Mary Ann played a vital role in establishing and maintaining religious communities throughout Lauderdale County, Alabama. The sources describe William George Gresham as traversing the county on horseback to preach and establish churches, and Mary Ann would have been instrumental in supporting this ministry while raising their young family.

=== Death and Burial ===

Mary Ann Whitten Gresham passed away on July 20, 1876, at the young age of 40, leaving William a widower with five young children, including infant daughter Mollie who was not quite two years old.<ref>Gresham family records; Find a Grave Index</ref> She was laid to rest at Pleasant Hill United Methodist Church Cemetery in Lauderdale County, Alabama.<ref name="findagrave">"Find a Grave Index," database, FamilySearch (accessed [DATE]), entry for Mary Ann Whitten Gresham.</ref>

Her death left a profound impact on the family. William would not remarry until December 8, 1880, when he married [[Lovelace-XXX|Evaline (Emaline) Lovelace]], daughter of Ace Lovelace, and had four additional children.

=== Legacy ===

Mary Ann is remembered in family records as "Polly Ann Whitten" or "Polly Whitten," reflecting the common practice of using "Polly" as a nickname for Mary.<ref name="death1934"/><ref name="death1953"/> Her descendants, particularly through her daughter Mollie Leona, continued the family's strong religious tradition and became prominent members of the Oakland and Lauderdale County communities.

=== Research Notes ===

==== Parentage Question ====

The exact parentage of Mary Ann Whitten requires further genealogical research. Two primary candidates exist:

'''Possibility 1: Daughter of Jonathan Whitten'''
* [[Whitten-533|Jonathan Whitten]] (b. abt 1795) married [[Murphy-4290|Jane Caroline Murphy]] (1807-1872) on 23 Dec 1834 in Lauderdale County, Alabama
* They had several children in Wayne County, Tennessee and Lauderdale County, Alabama
* A daughter born circa 1836 would fit the timeline for Mary Ann Whitten

'''Possibility 2: Daughter of Jesse P. Whitten'''
* [[Whitten-500|Jesse P. Whitten]] (1827-1882) married [[Duncan-3524|Martha E. Duncan]] (1832) on 14 Jun 1850
* However, their known daughter [[Whitten-510|Mary Francis "Fannie" Whitten]] was born abt 1854
* This timeline does not fit well for Mary Ann born 1836

'''Recommendation:''' Based on birth year (1836), Mary Ann was more likely the daughter of Jonathan Whitten and Jane Murphy rather than Jesse P. Whitten. Further research in:
* Wayne County, Tennessee census and church records (1830-1850)
* Lauderdale County, Alabama marriage records (1860-1870)
* Church of Christ records from the Oakland area
