== Family History and Ancestry ==

The ancestry of [[England-1357|David E. England]] reflects the convergence of several early settler families of the Shoals region of Alabama and Wayne County, Tennessee, with repeated connections through the Parish family and related pioneer networks.

Maternal Ancestry: White – Perkins – Hargrove

David’s maternal lineage traces from the Revolutionary-era frontier of Virginia and Kentucky into the Mississippi Territory.

His maternal grandmother, [[White-14146 |Myrtle White]] (1890–1980), was the daughter of [[White-14147 |Ervie White]] (1838–1897) and [[Hargrove-361 |Lydia Hargrove]]. [[White-14147 |Ervie White]] was the son of [[White-14189 |Dempsey White]] and [[Perkins-3681 |Nancy Perkins]]. [[Perkins-3681 |Nancy Perkins]] (born 1803) was the daughter of [[Perkins-1694|Jabez Perkins]] (1766–1836), a native of New Haven, Connecticut, whose family migrated through North Carolina and Virginia before settling in Kentucky.

[[Hargrove-361 |Lydia Hargrove]] was the daughter of [[Hargrove-287 |James M Hargrove]] (1818–1884), who in turn was the son of [[Hargrove-277 |Valentine Hargrove]] (born circa 1778). [[Hargrove-277 |Valentine Hargrove]] was a noted frontiersman associated with early settlement along the Hardin–Wayne County borderlands and was known for participating in frontier expeditions alongside his uncle-in-law, Colonel [[Whitely-757 |William Whitley]].

Paternal Ancestry: Lawson – Brewer – Scott – Pigg

David’s paternal maternal line is rooted in the agricultural, legal, and civic history of Wayne County, Tennessee.

His paternal grandmother, Ann Lawson, was the daughter of George Henry Lawson (1875–1963) and Eliza Ann Pigg (1881–1969). George Henry Lawson was the son of George Washington Lawson and Sarah Jane Brewer. Through Sarah Jane Brewer, this line descends from Rial (Ryal) Brewer, who served as High Sheriff and Tax Collector of Wayne County beginning in 1850.

Eliza Ann Pigg was the daughter of William T. Pigg (1842–1888), a Freemason, and Mary Jane Scott (1842–1907). Mary Jane Scott was the daughter of John Martin Scott (born 1791), a Wayne County Magistrate, and Mary Cynthia White. Members of this family were among the early settlers of the Cypress Inn and Martins Mills communities.

Connections through the Parish Family

Multiple ancestral lines converge through the Parish family, a prominent kinship network in Lauderdale County, Alabama.

David’s paternal grandfather, William Edward “Ed” England, married Nancy Pearl Parish (1890–1965), daughter of William Archibald Parish, Esq., a Justice of the Peace, and Mollie Leona Gresham.

William Archibald Parish was the son of Captain William John Brown Parish (1833–1883), a Confederate veteran and former prisoner of war. Captain Parish was involved in a well-documented incident in Florence, Alabama, involving the outlaw known as “Mountain” Tom Clark.

The Gresham family, from which Mollie Leona Gresham descended, was established in Lauderdale County by Thomas Gresham, regarded as the county’s first legal white settler.
