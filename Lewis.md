The early American history of the Lewis family involves several prominent branches, notably the Virginia Lewises tracing back to John Lewis (1678-1762) who emigrated from Ireland to found Staunton and produce Revolutionary War figures like General Andrew Lewis. Another significant lineage includes Meriwether Lewis (of the Lewis & Clark Expedition), a notable explorer born in Virginia, with cousins settling along early westward routes. Other Lewis families arrived as Huguenots or from Wales, establishing grist mills and contributing to colonial life, with members supporting the Revolution and settling new territories like Indiana and Tennessee. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Other Notable Early Families
