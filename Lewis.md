The early American history of the Lewis family involves several prominent branches, notably the Virginia Lewises tracing back to John Lewis (1678-1762) who emigrated from Ireland to found Staunton and produce Revolutionary War figures like General Andrew Lewis. Another significant lineage includes Meriwether Lewis (of the Lewis & Clark Expedition), a notable explorer born in Virginia, with cousins settling along early westward routes. Other Lewis families arrived as Huguenots or from Wales, establishing grist mills and contributing to colonial life, with members supporting the Revolution and settling new territories like Indiana and Tennessee. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
The Virginia Lewis Lineage (John Lewis of Staunton) 

• Origins: John Lewis (1678-1762) immigrated from Northern Ireland to Virginia after killing a landlord, settling in the Shenandoah Valley. 
• Settlement: He co-founded Augusta County, helped establish Staunton, and became a wealthy landowner, involved in frontier expansion. 
• Notable Descendants: His sons, Andrew Lewis (Revolutionary War General) and Thomas Lewis (Burgess), became prominent figures, continuing the family's political and military influence. [1, 3]  

The Meriwether Lewis Lineage 

• Explorer: Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809), born in Virginia, led the famed Lewis and Clark Expedition, exploring the Louisiana Purchase for President Jefferson. 
• Cousins: His cousin, James Lewis, settled near the Natchez Trace, connecting with the explorer's travels. [4, 5, 6]  

Other Notable Early Families 

• Huguenot Roots: Some Lewis families were French Huguenots who fled to America, establishing mills and providing supplies, like David Lewis who supplied the Continental Army. 
• Welsh/Irish Connections: Other branches came from Wales or Ireland, settling in areas like Pennsylvania, Maryland, and later expanding into Tennessee, Kentucky, and the Indiana Territory. [2, 7, 8]  

Key Themes in Early Lewis History

• Revolutionary Involvement: Members served in the military, as seen with Andrew Lewis and David Lewis.
