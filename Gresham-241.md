== Biography & Timeline==

**George Gresham** (c. 1740–1818) was a Virginian patriarch whose descendants helped settle the Shoals of Alabama and the Tennessee frontier. Genetic and documentary evidence places him in the Virginia line of Immigrant Edward, Haplogroup **R-M269** (subgroup **R-BY56690**), distinct from other U.S. Gresham branches.

### Birth & Origins
- Born c. **1740** in **Essex, Virginia**; confirmed descendant of the “Immigrant Edward” American line, not the Titsey, England line.

### Marriage & Family
- Married **Elizabeth (Betty) Watts** (c. 1745–1842); at least eleven children who migrated from Virginia through Georgia into middle Tennessee.
- Key children:
  - **Thomas Gresham (1761–1816):** Revolutionary War veteran; first legal white settler of Lauderdale County, Alabama; m. **Mary Thornton**.
  - **John Gresham:** Revolutionary War veteran from Virginia.
  - **George Gresham (c. 1764–?):** m. **Martha Thornton**.
  - **Benjamin Gresham (c. 1766–?):** m. a **Thornton daughter**.
  - Siblings: Sarah, Jane (m. McKenney), Dicey (m. Reviere), Mary, William, Philemon, Jarred, Kaufman, Frances, and Martha.
- The three sons’ marriages to **William Thornton’s** daughters anchored the kinship network at **Bluewater Creek** and the **Doublehead Reserve**.

### Ancestry Corrections for WikiTree
- Older research tied him to **William Gresham of Spotsylvania** (son of Thomas, d. 1741); **FTDNA Y-DNA** results disprove that connection.
- His lineage remains within the Virginia descendant line of **Edward the Immigrant**, Haplogroup **R-BY56690**.

### Death
- Died about **31 Dec 1818**, leaving a legacy of persistence as the family moved from Revolutionary logistics to permanent Southern settlements.

Note: The Big Y DNA Gresham Surname Study at FTDNA has raised serious doubts that he was the son of George b. 1710 and Sarah Dunweddie Gresham of King and Queen. Research is ongoing.
