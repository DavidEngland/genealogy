== Biography ==
{{Appalachia Sticker|born|state=Alabama}}

'''Mollie Leona Gresham''' was born on September 21, 1874, in Lauderdale County, Alabama. She was the daughter of [[Gresham-183|William George Gresham]] and [[Whitten-XXX|Mary Ann Whitten]]. Mollie grew up in a family defined by deep religious conviction and frontier resilience; her father, a former Civil War quartermaster, became a prominent circuit-riding minister in the Church of Christ following the war.<ref>Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresham'', 1976-1977, pp. 28, 48.</ref> Through her father's line, she was also the niece-in-law of T. B. Larimore, who founded the Mars Hill Bible School in Florence.

=== Marriage and Family ===

On January 15, 1890, at the age of 15, Mollie married [[Parish-XXX|William Archabald Parish (Esq.)]] in Lauderdale County, Alabama.<ref>"Alabama, Marriages, 1816-1957," index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/FQ9V-J5T : accessed 05 Sep 2013), W. A. Parrish and Mollie L. Gresham, 15 Jan 1890.</ref> Her husband, known as "Will," was a respected member of the community who served as a Justice of the Peace. He was the son of William Brown Parish and Rachael Emily Haddock, the latter of whom is credited with donating the land for the New Hope Church of Christ where the family remained active for generations.

Mollie and Will established their home in the Oakland area of Lauderdale County and were the parents of at least four daughters:

* [[Parish-370|Nancy Pearl Parish]] (1890–1965), who married [[England-1360|William Edward "Ed" England]]
* [[Miles-XXX|Mamie Lee Parish]] (1892–1977), who married Eli Miles
* [[Llewellyn-XXX|Bertha May Parish]] (1897–1985), who married Vernon Llewellyn
* [[Parish-392|Edith Naoma Parish]] (1905–1989)

=== Life and Legacy ===

Mollie's life spanned a period of significant growth and change in the Shoals area. She was part of a close-knit network of pioneer families—including the Greshams, Parishes, Whittens, and Englands—who settled the Cypress Creek country and built the region's foundational churches and schools. Her family records characterize her as being part of a "very religious" lineage, a common thread that influenced her role as a matriarch in the community.
