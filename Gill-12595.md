=== Early Life and Marriages ===
**Esther Gill** was born on 10 May 1755 in Virginia. She first married a Mr. Fuller, who died about a year after their marriage. She subsequently married the legendary pioneer **William Chapman Whitley**, with whom she had numerous children. Her marriage to Whitley linked her to an extensive frontier network; she was the sister-in-law of Sarah Whitley and Joseph Francis Lewis, the master brickmason who built "Sportsman's Hill".

The Whitleys came to Kentucky in November 1775. Their third child, **Levisa**, would be born at Harrodsburg and is said to be the second white girl born in Kentucky.

=== Revolutionary War Service ===
Esther Whitley was a central figure in the defense of the Kentucky frontier during the **"Bloody Sevens" (1777)**, a year of intense hostilities from British-allied Shawnee warriors. While traditional accounts often place her at Boonesborough, the sources specifically document her heroism during the **siege of Logan's Fort** (also known as St. Asaph's, located at Stanford).

==== The Siege of Logan's Fort (May 20–June 1777) ====
On May 20, 1777, approximately 100 Indian warriors descended on St. Asaph's Fort to destroy the dreams and lives of the settlers. At the time, only **15 men and 5 women** defended this outpost. **The siege lasted 56 days.**

Among the heroic women in the fort were:
* **Esther Whitley**
* **Mrs. George Rogers Clark** (Esther's sister)
* **Mrs. Ben Pettit**
* **Mrs. William Menifee**
* **Mrs. Benjamin Logan**

==== The Milking Incident (May 30, 1777) ====
Early on a Friday morning, Esther Whitley, Ann Logan, and an enslaved woman ventured outside the safety of the fort to milk cows, guarded by only a few men. They were ambushed by hostile Indians. While at least one guard was killed and others wounded, Esther and the other women reached the fort uninjured. Family tradition notes she even stopped to retrieve her hat under fire during this or a similar encounter.

==== Fort Duties and Combat ====
The women of the frontier did many of the same tasks as their male counterparts, including:
* Loading and firing guns
* Melting pewter platters into new bullets
* Caring for the injured
* Leaving the protection of the fort to get water and milk cows while under attack
* Killing enemy combatants and assisting the men with the protection of their families

Other records show that women were often outside the walls of the fort when hostile Indians attacked the individual homesteads.

==== Spiritual Leadership ====
To prevent panic among the children during the height of the attacks, Esther used the **Presbyterian Catechism** as a form of "psychological anchoring," reciting familiar verses to provide a sense of continuity and protection.

=== Later Life ===
Esther died in Woodford County at the home of her daughter **Ann Lewis Whitley Harper** on 20 November 1833, and is buried in the Old Harper graveyard near Midway, Kentucky.

Her husband, **William Chapman Whitley**, died in service of his country during the War of 1812 on 13 October 1813, at the Battle of the Thames.

=== Family ===
Esther and William Chapman Whitley were parents to:
* Esther Catherine (Whitley) Lewis
* Elizabeth (Whitley) Stephenson
* Isabella (Whitley) Sublette
* Levisa (Whitley) McKinney (said to be the second white girl born in Kentucky)
* Solomon Whitley

== DAR Recognition ==
The National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution approved Esther Whitley as a Revolutionary War patriot during the American Revolution. {{Society Ancestor|society=DAR|ancestor=A084472}}

== DAR Status and Red Flag ==
NOTE: The DAR has Red Flagged Esther Fuller Whitley with a requirement for future applicants to prove correct service.

"Future Applicants Must Prove Correct Service

The proof of service used to establish this person as a patriot is no longer valid. Subsequent evaluation of the proof of service may have determined that the proof is not acceptable under today's standards (examples: tombstone, obituary, undocumented genealogy or county history, family tradition); the service belongs to another person of the same name; the residence of this person during the Revolution is inconsistent with the service, or multiple people have claimed the same service. Future applicants must provide proof of service (and possibly residence) that meets current standards."

**Context for Future Applicants:** Primary source documentation supporting Esther's service at **Logan's Fort** (May–June 1777) includes the **Draper Manuscripts**, contemporary accounts in the **Esther Whitley Papers** maintained by the Logan-Whitley Chapter of the DAR, and newspaper documentation. Additional sources include "Collins History of Kentucky," "Early History of Lincoln County" by M.H. Dunn, and the Kentucky Historical Society archives.
