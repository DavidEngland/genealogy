== Research Notes ==
According to researcher Robin Mills (1998), Solomon and Elizabeth Barnett Whitley were both born in Northern Ireland, with Solomon born about 1720-1723. All of their children appear to have been born in the Augusta County, Virginia area.
There is some question about which individuals were Solomon's childrenversus his siblings. The Draper manuscript is cited as claiming thatSolomon Clark, William Chapman Whitley's nephew, heard William say hehad 3 brothers and 5 sisters and that he was the oldest brother. Thissuggests some records may have conflated siblings and children.
Solomon's siblings likely included twins Jonathan and Paul, Moses, Ann, and Michael. Michael Whitley was born about 1730 in Northern Irelandand died about 1777 in Philadelphia; his wife's name was Martha.
