:::      Pg.639: "Newberry District was settled chiefly by emigrants from Pennsylvania, and tradition has preserved the names of many of the early settlers. In the year 1752, 3 years previous to BRADDOCK's defeat, a native of Aberdeen, Scotland, named JOHN DUNCAN, removed from Pennsylvania to this section of the country and settled on a creek, which still bears his name. At that time, he was the highest settler, by 10 miles, on the Fork between the Broad and Saluda Rivers -- his nearest neighbor was Jacob Pennington, on the Enoree River below -- who is said to have been the only man, in the District, at that time, with negro, waggon, or still."
:::      Pg.652-653: "'James DUNCAN,' says MILLS, in a note, 'the son of the first settler, is the gentleman, who communicated many of the interesting particulars connected with the first settlement of this district. He was a young man when he came to the province, was through the whole of Col. Grant's war with the Indians, the war with them in 1776 and 1777, and in the revolutionary war. In the early settlement of the country, he followed hunting for seven years. His grounds embraced the whole country, the Catawba and Saluda Rivers, up to and among the mountains. This venerable and interesting character is still living.' (1826).
