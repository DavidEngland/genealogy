== Biography ==

'''Ruth Whitley Lewis''' (WikiTree ID: [[Lewis-8883]]) was born approximately '''1780''' in '''Lincoln County, Kentucky'''. She was the daughter of '''[[Lewis-9841|Joseph Francis Lewis]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Lewis-9841]]), a skilled brickmason originally from England or Ireland, and '''[[Whitley-753|Sarah Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-753]]). Through her mother, Ruth was the niece of the famed Kentucky pioneer '''[[Whitley-757|William Chapman Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-757]]), who built the first brick house west of the Blue Ridge Mountains and was renowned as an Indian fighter and frontiersman.

=== Notable Family Heritage ===

Through her paternal grandfather '''Joseph Lewis of Goochland''', Ruth inherited a lineage documented in heritage records extending back to English nobility. The '''Reade, Washington, and Martiau families''' connected to her ancestry are traced back through '''King John''' and '''nine of the Barons who signed the Magna Carta''', with direct descent documented through '''William the Conqueror''' and '''Charlemagne'''. Her family also maintained business connections with prominent Kentucky merchants, as Ruth and her husband Valentine were named as legatees in the estate of a King family member in Kentucky.

=== Frontier Family Network ===

Ruth's family represented the interconnected network of early Kentucky pioneers. Her uncle William Whitley was known to have worked closely with frontier figures including '''Daniel Boone''', '''John Hardgrove''', and '''General George Rogers Clark''' to build '''Crab Orchard Fort''' in Kentucky during the Revolutionary War era. The Lewis and Clark families were also prominent in the exploration of the Northwest Passage, connecting Ruth's family to some of the most significant figures in American frontier history.

Her father Joseph Francis Lewis contributed to the permanence and development of the Kentucky frontier through his skilled trade as a brickmason, while her mother Sarah came from a family deeply invested in both religious and military leadership during the early settlement period.

=== Marriage ===

Ruth married '''[[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Hargrove-277]]) on '''9 October 1799''' in '''Lincoln County, Kentucky'''. The marriage was witnessed by '''Samuel Lewis''' and '''James Hardgrove'''. Valentine was born around '''1778''' in '''Amherst, Virginia''', and was an early settler on the Kentucky frontier with close connections to the Whitley family through his marriage to Ruth.

=== Children ===

Ruth and Valentine had '''ten children''':

* '''Mary Hargrove'''
* '''Ruth Hargrove'''
* '''[[Hargrove-284|Elizabeth Louisiana Hargrove]]''' (1804–1862); settled in Missouri
* '''[[Hargrove-285|Samuel Ball Hargrove]]''' (b. 1806)
* '''Sarah Hargrove'''
* '''[[Hargrove-286|William Wesley Hargrove]]''' (1816–1876); died in Oregon
* '''[[Hargrove-287|James Monroe Hargrove]]''' (1818–1884); direct ancestor of the England family

* '''[[Hargrove-290|John Lindsey Hargrove]]''' (1826–1902)

=== Migration and Later Life ===

Following their marriage, Ruth and Valentine eventually migrated southward into the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands. Valentine established his home in '''Hardin County, Tennessee'''. The family's migration southward represents the broader pattern of frontier settlement expansion during the early 19th century.

The lineage of Ruth and Valentine Hargrove proved particularly significant to the history of the Shoals area through their son '''James Monroe Hargrove''' and his daughter '''Lydia Serena Hargrove''', whose marriage to '''James Ervin White''' linked the family to the '''Whitten''' and '''England''' family lines.

=== Death ===

Ruth is believed to have passed away before '''1840''' in '''Hardin County, Tennessee'''. Valentine died between '''1851 and 1860''', also in '''Hardin County, Tennessee'''.
