== Biography ==

'''William George Gresham''' was born on '''March 8, 1836''', in '''Haywood County, Tennessee''', into the humid, cotton-heavy world of the Deep South. He was the son of [[Gresham-191|Jarred Gresham]] and Susannah Ann Morrison. His father had carried the family's pioneering spirit from Georgia through Tennessee, establishing roots on the rich, dark soil of the frontier long before the clouds of war gathered on the horizon.

=== The Antebellum Years ===

In the golden twilight of the Old South, William was raised amidst the sprawling cotton fields of a Deep South plantation. As a young man, he was known as a figure of his time and place—a man of the earth and a farmer's son who understood the weight of the harvest and the complex social tapestries of the antebellum wilderness. Before the great conflict began, he lived according to the mores and contradictions of the era, a man whose personal conduct reflected the moral complexities of the plantation South.<ref>Gresham family oral history; Conversation History</ref>

=== Civil War Service ===

The romantic era of the planter ended abruptly with the blast of the bugle. In '''December 1861''', at '''Second Creek Campground in Tennessee''', William cast his lot with the Confederacy, enlisting in '''Company B of the 9th Tennessee Cavalry'''.<ref>"Confederate Enlistment Records," National Archives; Alabama Archives Military Records</ref> Rather than serving as a common foot soldier, he served as a '''quartermaster''', responsible for the vital and demanding task of sustaining the men who rode through the smoke and fire of the Western Theater.<ref>Gresham family records; Conversation History</ref>

{{US Civil War
| enlisted = Dec 12, 1861
| side = CSA
| regiment name = 9th Tennessee Cavalry
| company = B
| rank = Quartermaster
| discharge location = Lexington, Alabama
| discharge reason = Disabled}}

The war left him, as it left much of the South, shattered and changed. In '''spring 1865''', William was '''disabled and discharged at Lexington, Alabama'''.<ref>Confederate Discharge Records; Alabama Archives</ref> The man who had managed the logistics of war returned to a world that had been fundamentally swept away.

=== Spiritual Transformation ===

Returning to a devastated landscape, William underwent a profound spiritual and personal transformation. He traded the logistics of war for the logic of the Gospel, becoming a prominent '''minister in the Church of Christ'''. No longer a man associated with the wilder rumors of his youth, he became a '''circuit-riding preacher''', traversing '''Lauderdale County''' on horseback to establish the very foundations of faith in the Shoals area.<ref>Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresham'', 1976-1977; Conversation History</ref>

=== First Marriage: Mary Ann Whitten ===

In '''1865''', as he began his new life in ministry, William married '''Mary Ann Whitten''' (July 1, 1836 – July 20, 1876).<ref>"Alabama, Marriages, 1816-1957," database, FamilySearch</ref> The exact parentage of Mary Ann remains a subject of research. She may have been the daughter of [[Whitten-533|Jonathan Whitten]] and [[Murphy-4290|Jane Caroline Murphy]], who married 23 Dec 1834 in Lauderdale County, or connected to the broader "Wayne County preacher line" of the Whitten family.

William and Mary Ann were the parents of five children:

1. [[Gresham-182|Mollie Leona Gresham]] (September 21, 1874 – January 24, 1953)
   * Married [[Parish-XXX|William Archabald Parish (Esq.)]] on January 15, 1890
   * Mother of [[Parish-370|Nancy Pearl Parish]] who married [[England-1360|William Edward "Ed" England]]

2. Alice J. Gresham (birth date unknown)

3. Margaret "Maggie" Gresham (birth date unknown)

4. Sue Gresham (birth date unknown)

5. Unnamed son (died in infancy)

Mary Ann Whitten Gresham passed away on '''July 20, 1876''', leaving William a widower at age 40 with five young children, including an infant daughter Mollie who was not quite two years old.

=== Second Marriage: Evaline Lovelace ===

After several years as a widower, William married '''Evaline (also recorded as Emaline) Lovelace''', daughter of '''Ace Lovelace''', on '''December 8, 1880''' at her parents' home in '''Lauderdale County, Alabama'''.<ref>"Alabama, Marriages, 1816-1957," database, FamilySearch; Gresham family records</ref>

William and Evaline were the parents of four children:

1. J. Hubert Gresham (birth date unknown)

2. Elizabeth Gresham (born 1883)
   * Married John D. Hayes
   * Remained in Lauderdale County area

3. George Oscar Gresham (birth date unknown)

4. Lee Andrew Gresham (birth date unknown)

=== Later Life and Legacy ===

By the time of his death in '''1923''', the man once known for the revelries of the plantation had become a venerable patriarch of the Church of Christ, deeply respected throughout the Lauderdale County community. His transformation from Confederate quartermaster to circuit-riding minister represented the broader spiritual renewal that characterized many lives in the post-war South. He was buried in the soil of the Alabama borderlands he had helped to settle and sanctify, his legacy transformed from that of a warrior to that of a faithful minister who spent decades building spiritual foundations.<ref>Find a Grave Memorial #73628392</ref>

=== Research Notes ===

==== First Wife: Mary Ann Whitten ====

The exact parentage of Mary Ann Whitten requires further research. Based on her 1836 birth year, she was likely the daughter of [[Whitten-533|Jonathan Whitten]] (b. abt 1795) and [[Murphy-4290|Jane Caroline Murphy]] (1807-abt 1872), who married 23 Dec 1834 in Lauderdale County, Alabama. This timeline fits better than descent from Jesse P. Whitten's daughter [[Whitten-510|Mary Francis "Fannie" Whitten]] (b. abt 1854), who was too young.

Researchers should examine:
* 1850 and 1860 Wayne County, Tennessee census records for Whitten households
* Lauderdale County, Alabama marriage records from 1860-1870
* Church records from Wayne County Church of Christ and Methodist congregations

==== Second Wife: Evaline Lovelace ====

Further research needed on:
* Birth date and death date for Evaline
* Parents and siblings beyond father Ace Lovelace
* Census records for the combined family 1880-1920
