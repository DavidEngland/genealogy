## Biography

Arthur Holding Lewis was born October 15, 1848, in Triana, according to the Lewis family Bible. His middle name (sometimes given as "Holden") was probably chosen in honor of the neighboring plantation owner, Richard Holding, whose large monument is in the old section of the Madison City Cemetery after being moved from the airport during construction in 1984.

### Business and Civic Life

A. H. Lewis operated a general merchandise store at 104 Main Street, at the present corner with Wise Street in Madison, Alabama. That site later had the much larger store of Jim Williams, but it burned in 1942 and is now a parking lot across from Main Street Cafe.

Arthur H. Lewis served as a City Councilman from 1898 to 1901. In a 1913 special edition of the *Weekly Mercury* newspaper about the town of Madison, Arthur Lewis was described as "...among the most cheerful and entertaining gentlemen in all of Madison County". He was stated to be "...a Methodist Church Steward for over 30 years".

He was an officer of the Order of United American Mechanics, a patriotic society with objectives of supporting public education, assuring Bible readings in the schools, and limiting immigration to protect American jobs.

Arthur H. Lewis was a trustee of the "Madison High School" (believed to be the same as the Madison Training School) incorporated in February of 1895. The papers of incorporation list the trustees as A. H. Lewis, J. B. Floyd, C. G. Fennel, J. A. Watkins, M. A. Bishop, S. M. Doolittle, and J. A. Humphrey.
