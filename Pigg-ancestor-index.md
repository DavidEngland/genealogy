== Notes for Further Research ==

1. Several profiles (Pigg-86, Pigg-96, Pigg-97, etc.) need to be reviewed for biographical detail
2. Some children's spouses need additional documentation
3. Verify any discrepancies between GEDCOM imports and primary sources
4. Consider adding Find a Grave memorial links to all ancestor profiles
5. Census records provide strong verification of birth years and household composition
