The sources confirm that your **Gresham** and **Whitten** ancestors were deeply interconnected through marriage, geographic proximity, and a shared legacy of religious leadership that extended from Alabama and Tennessee into Mississippi.

### **Gresham and Whitten Family Connections**
The bond between these two families was cemented by several key marriages in the 19th and 20th centuries:
*   **The Primary Union:** Your ancestor **William George Gresham** (1836–1923) married **Mary Ann Whitten** (c. 1836–1876) around 1865.

==== Research Note: Mary Ann Whitten's Uncertain Parentage ====

The exact identity and parentage of Mary Ann Whitten (c. 1836–1876) requires further genealogical research. Several candidate lines exist:

**Possibility 1: Jonathan Whitten and Jane Murphy Line**
*   [[Whitten-533|Jonathan Whitten]] (b. abt 1795, Newberry, South Carolina) married [[Murphy-4290|Jane Caroline Murphy]] (1807–1872) on 23 Dec 1834 in Lauderdale County, Alabama
*   This couple had children in both Wayne County, Tennessee and Lauderdale County, Alabama
*   A daughter born circa 1836 would fit the timeline for Mary Ann Whitten
*   Jonathan was a son of [[Whitten-522|Charles Whitten Jr.]] (1769-c.1840) and [[Reagan-1066|Millicent Reagan]]

**Possibility 2: Connection to Jesse P. Whitten Line**
*   [[Whitten-500|Jesse P. Whitten]] (1827–1882) was a first cousin once removed to Jonathan Whitten
*   Jesse's family also resided in Wayne County, Tennessee and Lauderdale County, Alabama
*   The "Wayne County preacher line" may connect through this branch
*   However, Jesse's known daughter [[Whitten-510|Mary Francis "Fannie" Whitten]] was born abt 1854, making her too young to be William George Gresham's wife

**Recommendation:** Researchers should examine:
*   1850 and 1860 Wayne County, Tennessee census records for Whitten households
*   Lauderdale County, Alabama marriage records from 1860-1870
*   Church records from Wayne County Church of Christ and Methodist congregations
*   Estate records for Jonathan Whitten (d. aft 1872) and Jane Murphy Whitten (d. 1872)

*   Their daughter, **Mollie Leona Gresham**, further integrated these lines when she married **William Archabald Parish**, whose family was closely tied to the Whittens in the Oakland area.
*   **Other Intermarriages:** **Glennis England** (a descendant of the McDonald/England lines) married **Bessie Mae Whitten**. Additionally, **Minnie Lovelace** (a granddaughter of William George Gresham) married **Willie Whitten**.
*   **Community Ties:** These families settled together along **Cypress Creek** and the **Blue Water Creek** region, helping to build the foundational social fabric of Lauderdale County.

### **The Whitten Preachers and Religious Legacy**
The "distant sect of Whitten preachers" you noted fits into a broader family pattern of prolific religious service. While the sources specifically highlight **William George Gresham** (Mary Ann Whitten’s husband) as a prominent **Church of Christ minister** and circuit rider, the family network produced many leaders:
*   **Methodist Influence:** The Whittens were early members of **Wesley Chapel Methodist Church**, which was founded near family lands before 1816.
*   **Baptist and Church of Christ Leadership:** Other related lines produced ministers such as **James Whitley** (a Baptist minister) and **Stephen Emory McDonald** (a Primitive Baptist Elder).
*   **Sunday School Dedication:** **Alphonse McDonald** served as a Sunday School Superintendent for the **Free Will Baptists** for fifty years.

**Wayne County Whitten Ministers:**
The sources document multiple Whitten family ministers in Wayne County, Tennessee, creating what family tradition calls the "Wayne County preacher line":
*   Connection to the [[Whitten-522|Charles Whitten Jr.]] lineage through both Jonathan and Jesse P. Whitten branches
*   Multiple generations of circuit-riding ministers and Church of Christ leaders
*   Intermarriage with the Murphy, Duncan, and Gresham families created a network of religious leadership

### **Branches in North East Mississippi**
Your family’s presence in Northeast Mississippi is well-documented as a result of westward and southward migration:
*   **Tishomingo County:** **Katherine Gresham** (daughter of Thomas) moved to Tishomingo County around 1831. Later, **Altimira McDonald English** and her husband John English also settled there shortly after 1851.
*   **Alcorn County (Corinth/Farmington):** **John McDonald** (1861–1942) became a major landowner in **Farmington, Mississippi**, near Corinth. Many of his descendants remained in the area, including **J. W. McDonald**, who resided in Corinth into the modern era.
*   **Prentiss County:** Other kin, such as **Cornelius "Neal" McDonald**, have ties to **Booneville**.

### **Grandpa Thomas and "Old George" Gresham**
Your oral history regarding the relationship between your **"Grandpa Thomas"** and **"Old George" Gresham** is supported by the generational records in the sources:
*   **Direct Lineage:** **Thomas Gresham** (1761–1816), the first white settler in Lauderdale County, was the son of **George Gresham** (c. 1740–1818) and **Elizabeth Watts**.
*   **Lawrence County Connection:** The sources confirm that Thomas Gresham stopped and lived in **Lawrence County, Tennessee**, around 1800 while attempting to claim his Kentucky land grant.
*   **Oral History:** While the sources document Thomas’s residency in Lawrence County and his father George’s lifespan, the specific details regarding **George Gresham as a founder of Lawrenceburg** and his **friendship with Davy Crockett** are not explicitly detailed in the provided texts and remain a valuable part of your family’s unique oral tradition.

Thomas is buried in the **Gresham Cemetery** on Blue Water Creek, where his headstone uses the **"Grisham"** spelling—a variation often used by family members to distinguish themselves from Loyalist kin during the Revolutionary War.
