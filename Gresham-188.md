== Biography ==

'''Elizabeth Gresham''' (ca. 1805 – after 1860) was the eighth child of '''Thomas Gresham''' (Gresham-243) and '''Mary Thornton''' of Wilkes County, Georgia. Her father, a Revolutionary War veteran, became the first legal white settler along Bluewater Creek in Lauderdale County, Alabama (1816).

She married '''Joseph Manson Rice''' (ca. 1798–1852) in Lauderdale County, with the license dated between 12–20 September 1821. Joseph was a Virginia native (Hampton Road) who farmed successfully in Lauderdale County. When Mary (Thornton) Gresham’s estate was settled in 1831, “Manson Rice in right of his wife Elizabeth” received a distributive share, reflecting the land-and-kinship alliances of the Shoals frontier. Joseph’s 1852 will left Elizabeth $1,279.68; their son William T. Rice directed the estate, which distributed $6,398.41 among their four surviving children.

Children:
* '''William T. Rice''' (b. 1824), operated Mars Hill Iron Works and a Cox Creek machine shop.
* '''Thomas Gresham Rice''' (b. 1832), professor of Pure Mathematics at La Grange College.
* '''Martha N. Rice''', married James Wright (business partner of William).
* '''Mary E. Rice''', married Zedekiah Willett.

After Joseph’s death, Elizabeth remained in Lauderdale County. The 1860 census shows her in the household of her sister-in-law, widow Delila (Files) Gresham. Her death date is unrecorded; she is associated with Gresham family burials in the Mars Hill / Green Hill area.
