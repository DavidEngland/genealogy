The **16th Regiment (Burrus') of the Mississippi Militia** was a critical frontier defense force during the **War of 1812 and the Creek War**, primarily active in the northern reaches of the Mississippi Territory. To understand its role, it is essential to distinguish it from the **16th U.S. Infantry**, a regular army unit that fought in the Northern Theater, and the **16th Mississippi Infantry**, which served the Confederacy during the Civil War.

### **Formation and Leadership**
The 16th Mississippi Militia was commanded by **Lieutenant Colonel Charles Burrus**, who was appointed as the commandant on December 23, 1812. The regiment was uniquely composed of early pioneers from **Madison County** (in what is now Alabama), many of whom had been considered "intruders" on Chickasaw lands just years prior. Key leadership roles within the unit included:
*   **Adjutant:** **Valentine Hargrove**, who held significant administrative and organizational responsibilities.
*   **Second Major:** William Edmonson.
*   **Captains:** Samuel A. Allen, Daniel Atkins, William Crawford, William Evans, Stephen Griffith, Greaf Johnston, and William Moseley.

### **Service in the Creek War (1813)**
The regiment was activated in response to the escalating violence of the **Creek War**, specifically following the **Fort Mims Massacre** on August 30, 1813. While other units took the offensive, the 16th Regiment was tasked with the defensive mission of **"guarding of the frontiers of Madison County"** against the **Red Stick Creek** insurgency.
*   **Operational Window:** The unit was officially mustered into service on **October 8, 1813**, and discharged on **October 28, 1813**.
*   **Strategic Deterrent:** Though the field service was brief, the regiment served as a stationary deterrent that stabilized northern logistical corridors.
*   **Support for Andrew Jackson:** The presence of the 16th Regiment provided domestic security that allowed **Andrew Jackson** and the Tennessee Militia to use Madison County as a staging ground for their push into the Creek heartland.

### **Personnel and Societal Impact**
The muster rolls of the 16th represent a "who's who" of early **North Alabama** settlers, including names such as **Aaron Gibson, Amos French, and Benjamin French**. The unit was not a standing force but a militia model composed of farmers, blacksmiths, and land speculators whose primary motivation was the protection of their own property and families. This transition from illegal "intruder" status to recognized defenders of the republic helped facilitate the territorial consolidation that led to the eventual statehood of **Mississippi (1817) and Alabama (1819)**.

### **Historical Distinctions**
It is vital to avoid historical conflation between this unit and other "16th" regiments:
*   **16th U.S. Infantry (Regulars):** Led by **Colonel Cromwell Pearce**, this professional unit was engaged against British regulars along the **Niagara frontier** on the Canadian border.
*   **16th Mississippi Infantry (CSA):** Formed in 1861 at Corinth, this unit fought in the Eastern Theater of the **Civil War** under **General Carnot Posey**, participating in major battles such as **Antietam, Gettysburg, and the Siege of Petersburg**.
