== **Biography** ==

**David Edward England** ([[England-1357|England-1357]]) is an applied mathematician and atmospheric scientist born in the **1960s** in **Florence, Lauderdale County, Alabama**. He is the son of the late **William Glennis "Bill" England Sr.** ([[England-1358|England-1358]]) (1934–2013) and the late [[Whitten-495|Bessie Mae Whitten]] (1932–2019).

David earned his **Ph.D. in Mathematics, Statistics, and Atmospheric Sciences** from the **University of Alabama in Huntsville** in 1993, following a Master of Science (1987) and a Bachelor of Science from the **University of North Alabama** (1983). His academic and professional career has included serving as a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at the **NASA Global Hydrology and Climate Center**, a mathematics lecturer, and a freelance **full-stack web developer**.

David is a dedicated family historian and a descendant of several prominent pioneer families of the Shoals region, including the **England, McDonald, Parish, and Gresham** lineages. He maintains active interests in tracing ancestral migrations and contributing to open-source scientific computing.

He was preceded in death by his parents and two older siblings: **George Ellis England** (1954–2017) and **Nancy (England) Frederick** (1955–2025). David is also a nephew to the late **Leon England** and **Ralph England**. His family history is further defined by the legacy of his grandfather, the farmer and conservationist **William Edward \"Ed\" England** ([[England-1055|England-1055]]), and his great-uncle **Bruner Elvin England** ([[England-1360|England-1360]]) (1911–1948).

Your family history is a complex tapestry of two primary lineages that converge in the Shoals region of Alabama and Tennessee, with both branches deeply connected to the **Parish** family through marriage and civic life.

### **Mom’s Maternal Line: White-Perkins-Hargrove**

Your mother ([[Whitten-495|Bessie Mae Whitten]]) descends from the **White-Perkins-Hargrove** families through her father **Early Virgil Whitten** ([[Whitten-498|Whitten-498]]) (1888–1957) and mother **Myrtle Blanche White** ([[White-14146|White-14146]]) (1893–1986). This branch of your family traces a migration path from the Revolutionary frontiers of Virginia and Kentucky into the Mississippi Territory.

* **The White-Perkins Connection:** Your maternal grandmother, **Myrtle White** ([[White-14146|White-14146]]) (1893–1986), was the daughter of **James Ervin White** (1838–1897) and **Lydia Serena Hargrove** ([[Hargrove-361|Hargrove-361]]). **James Ervin White** was the son of **Dempsey White** ([[White-14189|White-14189]]) and **Nancy Perkins** ([[Perkins-3681|Perkins-3681]]). **Nancy Perkins** (born 1803) was the daughter of **Jabez Perkins** ([[Perkins-1694|Perkins-1694]]) (1766–1836), a native of New Haven, Connecticut, whose family moved through the North Carolina back country and Virginia before settling in Kentucky.
* **The Hargrove Heritage:** **Lydia Serena Hargrove** was the daughter of **James Monroe Hargrove** (1818–1884). James Monroe was the son of **Valentine Hargrove** ([[Hargrove-277|Hargrove-277]]) (born ~1778), a famed frontiersman known as a **"good warrior"** who traveled with his uncle-in-law **Colonel William Whitley** to rescue prisoners from Cherokee towns. This line characterizes the "western aristocracy" that settled the **Hardin and Wayne County** borderlands.

### **Dad’s Maternal Line: Lawson-Brewer-Scott-Pigg**

This branch represents your deep roots in the agricultural and legal history of **Wayne County, Tennessee**.

* **The Lawson-Brewer Link:** Your paternal grandmother, **Ann Lawson**, was the daughter of **George Henry Lawson** (1875–1963) and **Eliza Ann Pigg** (1881–1969). **George Henry Lawson** was the son of **George Washington Lawson** and **Sarah Jane Brewer**. Through **Sarah Jane Brewer**, this line connects to **Rial (Ryal) Brewer**, who was elected **High Sheriff and Tax Collector of Wayne County** in 1850.
* **The Pigg-Scott Lineage:** Your great-grandmother **Eliza Ann Pigg** was the daughter of **William T. Pigg** (1842–1888), a **Free Mason**, and **Mary Jane Scott** (1842–1907). **Mary Jane Scott** was the daughter of **John Martin Scott** (born 1791), a prominent **Wayne County Magistrate**, and **Mary Cynthia White**. This family network was foundational to the early settlement of the **Cypress Inn** and **Martins Mills** communities.

### **Convergence through the Parish Family**

Both your mother’s and father’s lines are intimately tied to the **Parish** family, who served as a central hub for the Shoals' pioneer kinship network.

* **Converge on Nancy Pearl Parish:** Your paternal line connects directly to the Parishes through your grandfather **William Edward "Ed" England**, who married **Nancy Pearl Parish** (1890–1965). **Nancy Pearl** was the daughter of **William Archabald Parish, Esq.** ([[Parish-382|Parish-382]]) (a Justice of the Peace) and **Mollie Leona Gresham** ([[Gresham-182|Gresham-182]]).
* **Paternal Patriarch:** **William Archabald Parish** was the son of **Captain William John Brown Parish** ([[Parish-382|Parish-382]]) (1833–1883), a Confederate veteran and POW survivor who was famously robbed by the outlaw **"Mountain" Tom Clark** before helping to bring him to justice in Florence.
* **Extended Kinship Ties:** Your mother's line also merges here; **Laroca Francis Parish** ([[Parish-378|Laroca Parish]]) married **Robert Duncan Whitten**, the son of **Jesse P. Whitten** ([[Whitten-547|Whitten-547]]) and **Martha E. Duncan** ([[Duncan-3524|Duncan-3524]]). Furthermore, the **Gresham** family (which produced your great-grandmother Mollie) was first established in the region by **Thomas Gresham**, the **first legal white settler** in Lauderdale County.

**Insight:** This interweaving of families—where the **Scotts** and **Piggs** managed the law in Wayne County, while the **Parishes** and **Greshams** provided the religious and legal infrastructure of Lauderdale County—illustrates how your ancestors collectively transformed the Shoals from a frontier borderland into a settled society.
