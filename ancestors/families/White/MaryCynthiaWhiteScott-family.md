To assist in your genealogical research, here is a formal inquiry and a summary of all known information regarding **Mary Cynthia White** and her parentage, based on the provided sources.

### **Inquiry for Local Historians and Researchers**

**Subject:** Parentage of Mary Cynthia White Scott (1814–1890) and the History of Granny Scott Hollow

"I am seeking definitive information regarding the parents of **Mary Cynthia White** (1814–1890), wife of Magistrate **John Martin Scott** of **Wayne County, Tennessee**. Genealogical records provided in the sources suggest her father was either **Thomas White** (c. 1780–1840) or **George White**, a foundational settler on **48 Mile Creek**. Her mother is recorded in family trees as '**Unknown Nerbern**' (c. 1780–1840), which appears to be a phonetic variant of the **Mewborn/Newbern/Newborn** surname family system.

I would like to connect with any local residents or historians in the **48 Mile Creek** area who have knowledge of **'Granny Scott Hollow,'** which was reportedly named in her honor. Any documentation or oral history clarifying the relationship between the **Whites** and the **Newborns** in early 19th-century Wayne County would be invaluable."

### **Known Information from Reliable Sources**

#### **Mary Cynthia White Scott (1814–1890)**

* **Vital Dates:** Born in 1814 in **Kentucky**; died in 1890 in **McNairy County, Tennessee**.
* **Marriage:** Married **John Martin Scott** (1791–1870), a prominent Wayne County Magistrate and Revolutionary War Tract holder.
* **Burial:** She is buried in McNairy County near her son, Franklin P. Scott.
* **Local Significance:** The location known as **"Granny Scott Hollow"** on 48 Mile Creek is named after her.

#### **Parentage: The White Branch**

* **Father Conflict:** Some records identify her father as **Thomas White** (c. 1780–1840). However, biographical sketches identify her as the daughter of **George White**, an "early settler in Wayne County" who owned a farm southwest of the J.N. Davis land.
* **Paternal Lineage:** If she is the daughter of Thomas, her grandparents were **William White** (c. 1760–1830) and **Rachael** (c. 1767–1840).
* **Migration Context:** The White family was part of a cluster of pioneering lineages, including the **Coopers**, **Simses**, **Lindseys**, and **Piggs**, who settled the **Western Highland Rim**.

#### **Parentage: The Mewborn/Newborn Branch**

* **Mother:** Her mother is listed as **"Unknown Nerbern"**.
* **Surname Variations:** The **Mewborn One-Name Study** documents that **Newbern**, **Newborn**, and **Mewbourne** are all variants of the original North Carolina surname **Mewboorn**.
* **Family Origin:** The lineage begins with **Thomas Mewboorn** (c. 1690–1749) of **North Carolina**.
* **Regional Presence:** Members of the Mewborn/Newborn family moved into Tennessee, including a branch that settled in **Macon, Tennessee**, around 1842. The **1891 Wayne County Census** lists **J. H. Newborn**, **T. J. Newborn**, and **Tobe Newborn** residing in Civil Districts 1 and 2, the same general area as the White and Scott families.
* **Kinship Link:** There is a documented multi-generational overlap between the **Webb** and **White** families; **Martha Newborn** married **Luther A. Webb** in Wayne County, and their son married into the local **White** lineage.

### **Research Background and Resources**

* **The Mewborn One-Name Study:** This study identifies Thomas Mewboorn as the sole progenitor of this surname in the Carolinas. The "Nerbern" spelling in the White Scott lineage is almost certainly a variation used by the Tennessee branch.
* **Geographic Ecosystem:** The sources describe the **Wayne-Hardin-Lauderdale** region as a **"regional social ecosystem"** where families often migrated together and intermarried across state lines. Mary Cynthia’s Kentucky birth and eventual settlement on the Tennessee-Alabama border align with the migration patterns of the **Mewboorn** and **White** families.
