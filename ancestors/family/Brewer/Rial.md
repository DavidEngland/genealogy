**Rial (Riley) Brewer, Esq.** (1817–1862) was a central figure in the mid-19th-century civic and military history of **Wayne County, Tennessee**. Born in North Carolina, he was the son of **Wiley Jackson Brewer** and **Margaret Cockman**. His lineage traces back to foundational settlers of the region, including his grandfather **Lanier B. Brewer Jr.**, who migrated from Brunswick, Virginia.

### **Civic Leadership as High Sheriff**
Rial was a prominent administrative figure in Wayne County during the 1850s.
*   **Election:** He was duly elected as the **Sheriff of Wayne County** on the first Saturday in March 1850.
*   **Tax Collection:** In addition to his role as Sheriff, he served as the **Collector of Public Taxes**. Records from December 1851 show he was audited for collecting over a thousand dollars in revenue for the state.
*   **Court Duties:** As Sheriff, he was responsible for summoning "good and lawful men" for the Circuit Court. Notably, in May 1851, he returned a juror list that included your other ancestor, **John Martin Scott**.
*   **Deputies:** Upon his election, he appointed **Thomas Meredith** and **Clabon Acklin** as his Deputy Sheriffs.

### **Civil War and Union Sympathies**
Your family tradition of **Union loyalty** is strongly supported by the historical records of both Rial Brewer and Wayne County.
*   **Military Service:** Rial served in the **10th Regiment Infantry (1st Middle Tennessee Infantry)**. This was a **Union Army** unit organized in Nashville between May and August 1862.
*   **Regimental Duties:** The regiment was attached to the Post and District of Nashville and was responsible for guarding the **Nashville & Northwestern Railroad**.
*   **County Context:** Rial’s Union service mirrors the political climate of Wayne County, which was a **pro-Union enclave** in Middle Tennessee. In the 1861 secession referendum, the county voted to remain in the Union by a significant margin of 905 to 409. This legacy transitioned into a "staunchly Republican" political identity that persists to the present day.

### **Family Life and Legacy**
Rial married **Hannah Horton** (1828–1899) in 1844. Together they had at least nine children, including your grandmother **Sarah Jane Brewer**, who eventually married into the **Lawson family**.

Rial died on **November 13, 1862**, in **Louisville, Kentucky**, while the Civil War was still raging. His burial is associated with the **Cave Hill National Cemetery** in Louisville, though family members are also interred in the **Brewer Cemetery** in the Whitten community of Wayne County. Through his children and his service as a lawman and soldier, he remains a pivotal patriarch of the Western Highland Rim.
