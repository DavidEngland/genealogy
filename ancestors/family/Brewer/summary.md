To help straighten out your Brewer ancestors, the sources provide a detailed look at the lineage of **Henry M. Brewer**, his estate, and his extended family connections in Tennessee.

### The Estate of Henry Brewer (Wayne County, TN)
It is established that **Henry M. Brewer** (c. 1780–1868) died without a will in Wayne County, Tennessee,.
*   **Administration:** In March 1853, **Henry Jefferson Brewer** (often referred to as Henry J. or H.J.) applied for and was granted letters of administration for the estate of Henry Brewer, deceased.
*   **The Auction and Heirs:** The estate was divided into nine parts, which implies nine children or sets of heirs. Known heirs and their connections include:
    *   **A.J. Brewer** (Andrew Jackson) and **H.J. Brewer** (Henry Jefferson).
    *   **Risner and Martin:** Shares went to **A.J. Risner** and **William Martin** (husbands of Henry’s daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah).
    *   **Household Items:** Your note that "Mary bought most of the household" matches records indicating Henry M. Brewer was married to **Mary Cockman** (born c. 1781),.
    *   **Other Shares:** Distributions were made to **Lewis A. Brewer**, the administrators of **Enoch Brewer’s** estate, and multiple **Hensley** heirs (suggesting a deceased daughter married a Hensley).
    *   **Neighbors and Buyers:** Estate records from this era often show close family and neighbors, such as **D.M. Spain**, buying livestock like sheep at auction.

### Separating the "Henrys"
There are several men named Henry in the records, which can cause confusion:
*   **Henry M. Brewer (c. 1780–1868):** The patriarch who lived in Lawrence and Wayne Counties and died intestate,.
*   **Henry Jefferson Brewer (H.J.):** Son of Henry M. and Mary Cockman; he was the administrator of his father's estate in 1853,.
*   **Henry H. Brewer:** Recorded in Laurel County, Kentucky, marrying Sarah E. Petree in 1894.
*   **Henry G. Brewer:** While not detailed in the provided biographies, several distinct Henrys appear in census and tax lists as the family expanded across Tennessee and Kentucky,.

### Royal Brewer and Royal Lawson
You mentioned a likely relation if **Royal Brewer** or **Royal Lawson** is involved.
*   **Royal Brewer:** He is documented as a **half-brother to Henry M. Brewer** and a son of **Lanier Brewer Jr.**,. He was born around 1775.
*   **Royal Ferguson Brewer:** Another Royal exists in the next generation; he was the son of **Cornelius Brewer** (Henry M.’s brother) and was named in honor of his uncle Royal.
*   **Royal Lawson:** The name appears in connection with the creation of the WikiTree profile for Henry M. Brewer, which was imported from a file titled "annie lawson ancestors.ged".

### Riley and Wiley
The sources mention both names, though they do not explicitly identify them as twins:
*   **Wiley Jackson Brewer:** Believed to be a **brother of Henry M. Brewer**. He lived near Henry in the Shoal Creek area of Lawrence County in 1819–1820,.
*   **Riley Brewer:** He appears in the 1850 and 1860 census for Hancock County, Tennessee, as the **son of Enos Brewer** (and grandson of Millenton Brewer),.

### DNA Evidence
DNA testing has confirmed relationships for descendants of this line:
*   **Y-DNA (Paternal Line):** Direct male descendants of this line, such as Junior Brewer (Kit #126838) and Terrence White (Kit #177950), have tested. Terrence White belongs to the **haplogroup I-Y23708**, which is a defining marker for this branch of the family,.
*   **Autosomal DNA:** Many descendants share DNA confirming their link to the Henry M. Brewer and Mary Cockman line, with shared percentages ranging from approximately **0.39% to 3.12%** among distant cousins,.
*   **Validation:** These matches provide genetic evidence for the documented genealogical lines descending from **Sarah Lanier** and **George Brewer Sr.**.
