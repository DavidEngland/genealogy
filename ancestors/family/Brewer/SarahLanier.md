Yes, the sources identify at least **three distinct women** known as Sarah Lanier or Sarah Lanier Brewer across different generations of the family line.

### 1. Sarah Lanier (c. 1686–c. 1727)
This is the **matriarch and primary progenitor** of the "Long Brewer Line".
*   **Family:** She was the daughter of **John Lanier II** and his second wife, Sarah (the widow of Sarah Edmunds).
*   **Marriage:** She married **George Brewer Sr.** around 1705 in Surry, Virginia.
*   **Children:** She is documented as the mother of **ten children**, including **Lanier Brewer Sr.**, Nicholas, Howell, and a daughter also named Sarah.
*   **Legacy:** Her marriage represents a "strategic alignment" of two colonial families, and she is the ancestor to whom modern DNA matches are traced to validate this lineage.

### 2. Sarah (Lanier) Brewer (1719–1782)
This Sarah appears to be the **daughter-in-law** of the matriarch described above.
*   **Marriage:** She married **Nicholas Brewer** (the son of George Brewer Sr. and the first Sarah Lanier).
*   **Life:** She was born and died in **Brunswick, Virginia**.
*   **Children:** Her children included Benjamin, Thomas, Nicholas Jr., and William Brewer.
*   **Note:** One source notes that while she is traditionally identified as a Lanier, researchers still look for definitive evidence confirming her maiden name.

### 3. Grace Wilkinson Lanier Brewer (1920–2016)
In the modern era, the name continued as a **double surname** or through marriage.
*   **Identity:** Born **Grace Wilkinson Lanier**, she was the daughter of Sterling Sidney Lanier Jr..
*   **Marriage:** She became a "Lanier Brewer" by marrying **Carlos Breckenridge Brewer**.
*   **Civic Role:** She was a prominent member of the **DAR and Colonial Dames**, organizations dedicated to preserving the very colonial lineages (like the 1705 Brewer-Lanier union) found in your research.

### Potential Confusion: Sarah Brewer (born c. 1714)
It is important to distinguish these from **Sarah Brewer**, the daughter of George Brewer Sr. and the first Sarah Lanier. She was a Brewer by birth but became **Sarah Vick** after marrying John Vick, Jr..

### DNA Validation
Genetic evidence supports the connection to the earliest **Sarah Lanier (c. 1686–1727)**. Autosomal DNA matches between distant cousins—such as Ron James and Marylyn May—provide "mathematical proof" of their shared 18th-century ancestry through her and George Brewer Sr.. These matches are consistent with the inheritance patterns expected for 7th cousins once removed.
