The ancestors of **John Washington Hargrove Sr.** transitioned from **Puritan and Quaker pioneers** in the Virginia Tidewater to the **"Christian soldier" archetype** that defined the later generations of frontier warriors. While John Washington Hargrove and his sons—including **William**, the "Range Captain" and Indian fighter, and **Valentine**, the "good warrior"—were renowned for their martial prowess, their lineage reveals a complex history of **religious dissent, civic stewardship, and survival** on the early colonial edge.

### **The Paternal Lineage (Hargrove/Hargrave)**
*   **Samuel Hargrave Sr. (1712–1777):** The father of John Washington Hargrove was a **prominent Quaker** and served as the Clerk of the **Cedar Creek Monthly Meeting** for over fifteen years. Unlike his sons, who abandoned pacifism during the American Revolution, Samuel adhered to the tenets of the Society of Friends. However, family tradition notes that his **grave was desecrated by British troops**, prompting his sons to hide the family horses in a swamp to prevent their seizure.
*   **Bray Hargrave (ca. 1668–1728):** John’s grandfather was a **manager of a large plantation** and an overseer in Surry County. Records indicate he was **qualified for militia service in 1687**, demonstrating that the family's involvement in local defense preceded their deep integration into the Quaker faith.
*   **Richard Hargrove V (1645–1704):** This ancestor was a **pivotal religious dissenter**. In 1682, he was brought to court for his **"bizarre and outrageous Quaker fashion"** of refusing to baptize his children. Described as "stubborn" and "abrasive," he eventually moved up the James River to Surry County to escape the pressures placed on the "pestilent sect" by the Virginia authorities.
*   **Richard Hargrave IV (ca. 1614–1686):** The immigrant ancestor was a **Puritan (Roundhead)** who arrived at Point Comfort in 1635 as an indentured servant. He became a **moderately prosperous landowner** and a respected citizen, serving on **grand juries, inquests, and as an estate appraiser**. His grit was evidenced by his service as a **bondsman** and his receipt of a **bounty for killing a wolf**.

### **The Maternal Lineage (Cheadle/Southern)**
*   **John Cheadle II (1691–1768):** A grandfather to John Washington Hargrove, he was a **road supervisor** in Caroline County and a member of the Quaker faith.
*   **John Southern (ca. 1601–ca. 1695):** A 2nd great-grandfather, he was an **artisan and soldier** who arrived at Jamestown in 1820. He was tasked with establishing an ironworks but was **wounded in a conflict with Indians** at Falling Creek. Despite this, he became an **influential leader**, serving as an attorney, juror, and a **Burgess for James City** in 1624, 1629, and 1632.

This ancestral background suggests that the Hargrove "warrior" spirit was rooted in a multi-generational legacy of **defending legal rights, maintaining civic order, and enduring the physical dangers** of the first permanent English settlements in America.
