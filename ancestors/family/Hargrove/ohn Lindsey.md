**John Lindsey Hargrove** was born on **January 24, 1826**, in **Madison, Alabama**, during the era when his parents were establishing themselves as foundational settlers in the **Tennessee-Alabama borderlands**. He was the son of the noted frontier warrior **Valentine Hargrove** and **Ruth Whitley Lewis**, born when his father was 48 and his mother was 46. His heritage linked him to the influential **Lewis-Ball-Hargrove** network, which had migrated from the Virginia Tidewater through the Kentucky wilderness to the **Alabama Shoals**.

In **1852**, at the age of 25, John Lindsey married his first wife, **Caroline Garrard**. Together, they had **ten children** born between 1853 and 1873: Mary Ruth, Omar Stanley, Rutillious Garrard, Henry Valentine, William Douglas, James Grant, Rufus Franklin, Ulysses Shelby, Mariah Jane, and Thomas G. This large family mirrored the prolific nature of the Hargrove line, which used such extensive kinship networks to provide security and social standing on the early American frontier.

John Lindsey eventually joined the mid-19th-century pioneer push further west, relocating to **Texas**. Following the death of his first wife, he married **Cora M. West** on **August 25, 1875**, in **Hood County, Texas**. From this second marriage, he had two additional children, John Joseph and Alameda Penelope, born between 1877 and 1882.

His life spanned the transition of the southern frontier from the "Alabama Fever" era to the permanent settlement of the Western territories. Having lived a long life of 76 years, **John Lindsey Hargrove** died on **May 21, 1902**, in **Colorado City, Mitchell County, Texas**. He was buried in the **Spade Cemetery** in Mitchell, Texas, marking the final westward expansion of the branch of the family that had begun generations earlier in **Middlesex,
 Virginia**.
