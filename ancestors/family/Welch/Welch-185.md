== Biography ==

'''Major Nicholas Welch''' was born circa 1738 in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to [[Welch-186|John Welch]] (1712–1775) and [[Whiteside-2764|Elizabeth (Whiteside) Welsh]] (1717–1742). He became a controversial figure during the American Revolution as a '''Loyalist Major''' in the Royal British Army, fighting against the Patriot cause at the Battle of Ramsour's Mill in North Carolina. His life traces a remarkable arc from established landowner to ruined exile, and finally to Tennessee frontier settler—embodying both the divisions of the Revolution and the reconciliation that followed.

=== Introduction: A Study in Allegiance and Consequence ===

The American Revolution was more than a war for independence; it was a bitter civil conflict that pitted neighbors, friends, and even family against one another. Nicholas Welch's story is a powerful embodiment of this struggle, encapsulating the profound divisions, devastating personal costs, and eventual, improbable reconciliation that defined the era. His journey—from an established landowner in the Carolina backcountry, to a zealous Loyalist officer on the battlefield, a ruined petitioner in the courts of London, and finally a pioneer on the Tennessee frontier—provides a compelling case study of the Loyalist experience.

=== From the Pennsylvania Frontier to Carolina Society ===

Born around 1738-1740 in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Nicholas Welch was the son of John Welch and Elizabeth Whiteside, part of the great wave of Scotch-Irish Presbyterian immigration that transformed the Appalachian frontier. Following his mother's death when he was only four years old, Nicholas was raised in a world that valued fortitude and self-reliance. By the 1760s, he had followed the migratory current of the Great Wagon Road southward, establishing himself as a landowner in Tryon County, North Carolina (later Lincoln County). His standing in the community was formally recognized in 1769 when he was granted letters testamentary to administer the estate of his late father, John.

Around 1757, Nicholas married '''[[Moore-51757|Elizabeth E. Moore]]''' (1740–1799), daughter of a Virginia planter, traditionally identified as [[Moore-1641|John William Moore]] of New Kent and Hanover Counties. While genealogical records lack a definitive primary source for this connection, the union undoubtedly anchored him to the Southern gentry and produced a large family. Through land, marriage, and family, Welch had become a man of considerable substance, deeply rooted in the Carolina soil.

=== Allegiance to the Crown: A Loyalist in the American Revolution ===

Nicholas Welch's decision to remain loyal to the British Crown rested at the heart of the "Loyalist Gamble"—the cornerstone of Lord Cornwallis's entire Southern strategy. This high-stakes plan presupposed that a timely uprising of organized local Loyalists, supported by British regulars, could restore Royal authority.

==== The Choice of Loyalty and Early Persecution ====

From the outset of the "dissentions in America," Welch's sympathies lay with the King. This allegiance made him a target for the ascendant Patriot authorities. In his later Memorial to the British government, he recounted how he was twice arrested and imprisoned on charges of "Treason against the State." He secured his release only through the intervention of attorneys, at a "great expence of One hundred & fifty pounds"—a significant sum that demonstrated both his personal means and the high cost of his political convictions.

==== Raising a Regiment and Service in the South ====

Finding it impossible to remain in North Carolina without taking up arms against the Crown, Welch made the fateful decision to join the British army. Hearing of the expedition against Georgia, he assembled a force of 270 local Loyalists and "sat out for that Province," leaving his family and property behind. The march was a brutal ordeal; Welch's column was pursued and attacked three times by Rebel forces. Over fifty of his men were killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, and others abandoned the enterprise.

Despite these losses, Welch and a determined remnant of ninety men joined Colonel Archibald Campbell's army at Briar Creek, Georgia, in February 1779. His leadership and commitment were immediately recognized, and he was appointed '''Major of the Royal No. Carolina Regiment''', also known as '''Hamilton's Regiment'''. In this role, he frequently ventured "privately into the enemy's Country" to recruit other Loyalists, successfully enlisting a considerable number of men for His Majesty's Service.

==== The Fateful Battle of Ramsour's Mill ====

The Battle of Ramsour's Mill on June 20, 1780, was the disastrous climax of Welch's military career and a pivotal strategic failure for the British. Lord Cornwallis had expressly advised North Carolina Loyalists to remain quiet and wait for the support of the main British army. However, driven by ambition, Welch and Lt. Colonel John Moore chose to act prematurely.

In the weeks preceding the battle, Welch presented a charismatic and compelling figure. Contemporary accounts describe him appearing in a "brilliant red uniform," exhibiting "a considerable quantity of gold coins," and using his skills as a "great orator" and the "judicious use of his guineas" to rally supporters:<ref>"Sketches of Western North Carolina Illustrating Principally the Revolutionary Period of Mecklenburg, Rowan, Lincoln and Adjoining Counties" (database on-line)</ref>

> Nicholas Welch, who had lived just above Moore on Indian Creek, went from this vicinity eighteen months prior to this and joined the British army. He appeared dressed in a new uniform and exhibiting a considerable quantity of gold coins, representing himself as Major of Hamilton's Regiment. He urged the men to embody at once, telling of the fall of Charleston, Buford's defeat, and the bad condition of affairs for the Americans everywhere. By his narratives and judicious use of his guineas he prevailed over Moore and it was determined to organize at once.

His efforts were highly effective, and by mid-June, approximately 1,300 Loyalists had gathered at Ramsour's Mill. On June 20, 1780, a smaller Patriot force of around 400 militia under Colonel Francis Locke launched a surprise attack. The battle was a chaotic and brutal affair, fought between men who were often neighbors and kinsmen. With no uniforms to distinguish friend from foe, Patriots pinned white paper to their hats, while the Loyalists wore green twigs. The smaller Patriot force ultimately routed the larger, less-organized Loyalist militia. Three of Welch's sons—Thomas, William, and Nicholas, Jr.—were reportedly among the captured.<ref>"Battle of Ramsour's Mill," North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program, Marker O-3, North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources</ref>

The defeat was a devastating blow to the Loyalist cause, shattering Cornwallis's recruitment strategy. British commanders were furious, and for Welch, the military disaster would soon be followed by catastrophic personal consequences.

=== The Price of Defeat: Banishment, Exile, and Ruin ===

The Patriot victory reshaped the political and social landscape of the Carolina backcountry, turning active Loyalist combatants into hunted refugees. For Nicholas Welch and his family, defeat on the battlefield translated directly into personal and financial ruin.

==== Family Banishment and Property Confiscation ====

In his 1786 Memorial, Welch detailed the severe repercussions his family faced following the decisive Patriot victory at King's Mountain in October 1780. The North Carolina authorities moved swiftly against the families of prominent Loyalists. His wife, Elizabeth, and their nine children were formally "Banished that Province." Rebel forces seized all of his property, including 600 acres of developed land and "two valuable Negro Slaves." His family was, in his words, "stript... of every thing they had, except only a small part of their wearing apparel," and sent as refugees into Georgia.

==== A Refugee's Path ====

Upon hearing of his family's "distressed situation," Welch felt compelled to prioritize their survival over his military duties. He left his regiment at Wilmington in May 1781 and, lacking any other means to support them, resigned his commission for the "trifling Sum of £150." For the remainder of the war, he and his family lived as refugees within British lines, moving from Georgia to East Florida (until 1784), and finally to New Providence in the Bahamas. Their life was one of constant uncertainty and hardship, dependent on government provisions for survival.

=== A Plea to the Crown: The Memorial of 1786 ===

From his refuge in the Bahamas, Nicholas Welch undertook one last mission on behalf of his family: a journey to London to petition the Crown for compensation. His 1786 Memorial to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury is a carefully constructed narrative of victimhood, a formal yet desperate appeal from a ruined subject. In it, he meticulously outlines his unwavering loyalty, his active military service, and the immense suffering both he and his family endured.

Presented in London on March 20, 1786, the petition concludes with a poignant request for relief:

> Half Pay... or some equivalent compensation, to enable him to return to his numerous & helpless family, who are now exposed to the greatest hardship, misery & want; without a dawn of hope for relief but from the Benevolence of His most Gracious Majesty and His Ministers.

His claim detailed losses amounting to £1,150 sterling. After review, the Crown awarded him £448 sterling—only a fraction of what he sought, but enough to provide the means for his return and the beginning of a final, unexpected chapter in the newly independent United States.

=== A New Beginning on the American Frontier ===

In a profound historical irony, Major Nicholas Welch—the committed Loyalist who had lost everything fighting against the American cause—returned to the very nation he had opposed to build a new life. On the Tennessee frontier, far from the political animosities of the Carolinas, the former Tory major found an opportunity to begin again.

==== Westward Migration and Settlement in Tennessee ====

After receiving his compensation in London, Welch and his family did not remain in the Bahamas. Their path led them back to the American South and then westward. The family appears briefly in South Carolina and Kentucky records before putting down new roots in '''Giles County, Tennessee'''. There, in a land of new beginnings populated by veterans from both sides of the Revolution, Nicholas Welch appears on the 1812 county tax list and as a signatory to an 1813 petition concerning land titles, indicating his re-establishment as a settled landowner.<ref>Tennessee Genealogical Records Repository, Giles County, TN Miscellaneous Genealogical Notes</ref>

==== Final Years and Estate ====

Major Nicholas Welch died in December 1814 in Giles County, Tennessee. His estate was administered by a Sarah Welch, creating some ambiguity for historians. While one source identifies her as his daughter [[Welch-8497|Sarah Welch]] (b. 1766), another suggests she may have been a third wife whom he married in Tennessee after 1810. The probate records confirm:

> Ordered letters of adm. of est. of Nicholas WELCH, dec'd, issue to Sarah WELCH, she having qualified.

Subsequent court orders appointed commissioners to allot provisions for "Sarah WELCH, widow of the late Nicholas WELCH," definitively establishing his death in Giles County, Tennessee by December 1814.

=== Legacy and Family Reconciliation ===

The most profound aspect of Nicholas Welch's legacy lies in the theme of familial reconciliation with the new republic. While the Major's life was defined by his service to King George III, the next generation of his family fully embraced an American identity. In a remarkable turn of history, his son '''[[Welch-1890|Lewis Welch]]''' and his grandson '''[[Welch-1883|Elijah C. Welch]]''' both served in the military for the United States during the War of 1812, fighting against the very British forces their patriarch had once commanded.

Through Elijah's daughter '''[[Welch-1878|Serena Welch]]''' (c. 1833–1884), the Welch line married into the '''[[Hargrove-279|Hargrove family]]'''—themselves descendants of Patriot Revolutionary War veteran [[Hargrove-261|John Washington Hargrove Sr.]], whose son [[Hargrove-277|Valentine Hargrove]] was a War of 1812 veteran. This marriage symbolized the complete reconciliation of former enemies' families in the Tennessee frontier.

The Welch family's journey—from Royalist Major to patriotic American soldiers in less than two generations—serves as a powerful symbol of the healing of Revolutionary divisions and the forging of a new, unified nation on the ever-expanding American frontier.

=== Marriage and Family ===

Nicholas married '''[[Moore-51757|Elizabeth E. Moore]]''' (1740–1799) around 1757 in North Carolina. Their children included:

* [[Welch-8499|John Welch]] (b. 1758)
* [[Welch-3467|William C. Welch]] (b. c. 1758)
* [[Welch-8495|Judith Welch]] (b. 1761)
* [[Welch-11475|Nicholas William Welch]] (b. 1762)
* [[Welch-8473|Mary (Welch) Misick]] (b. 1762)
* [[Welch-1567|Margaret E. (Welch) Huddleston]] (b. c. 1765)

* [[Welch-8500|Richard Welch]] (b. 1770)
* [[Welch-1890|Lewis Welch]] (b. 1780)

Through Lewis Welch, Nicholas became the great-grandfather of [[Welch-1883|Elijah C. Welch]] (1810–1867) and great-great-grandfather of [[Welch-1878|Serena Welch]] (c. 1833–1884).
