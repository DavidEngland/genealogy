The sources provide several details regarding the marriage of **John Martin Scott** (1791–1870) to his second wife, **Mary Cynthia "Granny" White**, as well as information about his first wife and suggested research avenues.

### **Marriage to Mary Cynthia "Granny" White**
*   **Marriage Date:** The exact marriage date is not explicitly recorded in the sources, but it likely occurred around **1830 or 1831**. This is deduced because his first wife died around 1829, and his first child with Mary Cynthia, Frederick Marion Scott, was born in 1832.
*   **Location:** The marriage almost certainly took place in **Wayne County, Tennessee**, where John Martin Scott was an established **Magistrate** and landowner on **48 Mile Creek**.
*   **Spouse Details:** Mary Cynthia White was born in **Kentucky in 1814**. She was the daughter of **George White** (or possibly Thomas White), an early pioneer settler in Wayne County. She survived her husband, living with her youngest son, Frank, in 1880, before passing away in **1890**. She is buried in **McNairy County, Tennessee**, near the family of her son, Franklin Pierce Scott.

### **Information on the First Wife**
*   **Identity:** Her name was **Anna Elizabeth**.
*   **Maiden Name:** The sources suggest her maiden name was likely either **Carrell** or **Snapp**.
*   **Marriage Date:** They were married around **1822**.
*   **Location:** While they resided in Wayne County, one record suggest they passed through **Williamson County, Tennessee**, prior to 1817, suggesting the marriage may have occurred during their westward migration.
*   **Death:** She died approximately in **1829**.
*   **Children:** They had one known son, **Samuel E. Scott** (Rev. Samuel Scott), born on **March 6, 1823**, in Wayne County. Samuel later became a minister and married **Lydia Keeton**.

### **Research Strategies and Suggested Sites**
To further your research into the specific marriage records and the identity of the first wife, the following resources are recommended based on the sources:

*   **FamilySearch.org:** Look for **Civil Court records** and **Deeds** for Wayne County. While a fire in 1972 destroyed many original marriage bonds, some early deeds (beginning in 1823) and wills (beginning in 1848) are digitized and may mention family relationships.
*   **WikiTree:** Access the profiles for **John Martin Scott (Scott-9213)** and **Mary Jane (Scott) Pigg (Scott-7950)**. These profiles are actively managed and often contain updated DNA evidence and imported GEDCOM data.
*   **Wayne County TNGenWeb:** This site contains transcribed **court minutes** (such as the 1849–1851 records) that may mention John Martin Scott in his capacity as a Magistrate or in estate settlements.
*   **Find A Grave:** Search for **Memorial #29766127** (John Martin Scott) and related burials in the **Jackson Cemetery** in Collinwood and the **Lawson Cemetery** in Wayne County.
*   **Lawrence County Archives:** Since the Scott family was part of a "regional social ecosystem," checking records in neighboring Lawrence County (formed in 1817) for early deeds or marriage bonds may yield results.
*   **Ancestry.com Property Records:** Search for **Revolutionary War Land Warrants** and **Early Tax List Records** (specifically the 1826 and 1836 lists) to find mentions of John Martin Scott's 200-acre tract on 48 Mile Creek.
