== Biography ==

Thomas Anderson McDonald (1822–1885) was an American blacksmith who lived in Tennessee and Alabama during the mid-19th century. He was born in 1822 at Wartrace, Bedford County, Tennessee, the son of [[McDonald-3121 | John McDonald]] (c.1792–c.1860) and [[Emory-1 | Margaret Emory]] (c.1793–c.1880), following the family’s migration from South Carolina.

Thomas was raised in a family with strong Scots-Celtic roots traditionally associated with Clan Donald. Several of his brothers became well-known gunsmiths in northern Alabama, while Thomas practiced primarily as a blacksmith, a vital trade in frontier communities.

On 24 June 1852, he married Sarah A. Adkinson in Lawrence County, Tennessee. After their marriage, they lived at Wayland Springs in Lawrence County, where several of their children were born. By about 1860, the family had moved to Wayne County, Tennessee, and by 1870 they were living on Cypress Creek in Lauderdale County, Alabama, near Thomas’s brother [[McDonald-2 | John Scruggs McDonald]]. By 1881, the family resided in Cloverdale (also known as Rawhide), Lauderdale County, Alabama.

Family oral history states that following the 1881 Lock Six payroll robbery on the Muscle Shoals Canal, Frank and Jesse James stopped at Thomas McDonald’s farm, where his son John tended their horses. This account has not been documented in contemporary records.

Thomas Anderson McDonald died in 1885 in Lauderdale County, Alabama. He was buried in Savannah Cemetery, Savannah, Hardin County, Tennessee.

== Children ==

Thomas Anderson McDonald and Sarah A. Adkinson had ten children, born between 1855 and 1873:

== Research Notes ==

* '''Surname variation:''' Census and other records frequently record this family as *McDaniel* rather than *McDonald*. This variation appears in multiple federal censuses, including 1850 and 1860. Researchers should search under both surnames.
* '''Occupation:''' Although closely associated with a prominent McDonald gunsmith family, available records indicate Thomas practiced primarily as a blacksmith rather than as a gunsmith.
* '''Residence history:''' Records place Thomas and his family in Lawrence County, Tennessee (1850s), Wayne County, Tennessee (c.1860), and Lauderdale County, Alabama (1870–1885).
* '''Oral tradition:''' The reported encounter with Frank and Jesse James is based on family oral history and should be treated as anecdotal unless corroborating documentation is found.

If you want, I can:

* Tighten this further to a **“short-form” WikiTree bio**
* Split out a **“Biography” vs. “Timeline”** format
* Normalize it fully against **WikiTree Style Guide examples** (especially children formatting and sourcing)
