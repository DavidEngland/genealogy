Based on the sources, your record for **John and Phebe White** aligns closely with the foundational **White family of Whitley County, Kentucky**, and **Wayne County, Tennessee**, who were prominent members of the "regional social ecosystem" in the early 19th-century frontier.

### **Match for John White (b. 1767/1768, North Carolina)**
The most significant match for your John White is **John Calvin White Sr. (White-12146)**.
*   **Birth and Origins:** He was born circa **1768** in **Bute County (now Warren County), North Carolina**. He came from a family of prosperous farmers who had been in North Carolina since 1747.
*   **Kentucky Settlement:** By **1804**, he was established in **Whitley County, Kentucky** (then part of Knox County), where he paid taxes on 300 acres along the **Cumberland River**.
*   **Civic Role:** He was a prominent figure, identified in court records as **"John White Esq."**.
*   **Death:** He died in **January 1830** in Whitley County, Kentucky. Following his death, the court ordered that his law books be returned to the Commonwealth and his records transferred to his successor.

### **The "Phebe White" (b. 1780, Tennessee) Connection**
While the direct name "Phebe White" does not appear as a spouse for John Calvin White Sr. in the primary indices—which list his wives as **Mary Unknown**, **Mary Barber**, and **Mary Shelton**—the birth year of **1780** and the location of **Tennessee** provide strong circumstantial links to other family matriarchs:

*   **The "Unknown Nerbern" Link:** Records for the White/Scott line identify the mother of **Mary Cynthia "Granny" White Scott** as an **"Unknown Nerbern"** (Newborn/Mewborn) born circa **1780**. This matches your Phebe’s birth year and regional context perfectly. Granny Scott’s father is variously listed as **George White** or **Thomas White**, both of whom were sons of the elder John Calvin White Sr..
*   **Potential Nickname:** You suggested Phebe might be a nickname. In this era, "Phebe" was occasionally used interchangeably with **Euphemia** or even **Susannah** in some family traditions, though the sources also document a **Phebe Frost** (daughter of Thomas Frost Jr.) who married into the interrelated Standifer family and lived nearby.
*   **Migration Patterns:** Your record of the family living in **Illinois** and **Tennessee** is corroborated by the sources; descendants of the Whitley County Whites, specifically the line of **Dempsey E. White**, were foundational pioneers who settled in **Hardin and Wayne Counties, Tennessee**, and several branches later moved into **Arkansas and Illinois**.

### **The Dempsey White Link**
Your John White is the father of **Dempsey E. White** (1798–1859), who became a central figure in the **Wayne County** group. In 1830, Dempsey was the one required by the court to return the legal records belonging to his deceased father, **John White Esq.**. Dempsey married **Nancy Perkins**, further cementing the connection between the Whites and the prominent **Perkins and Gresham families** of the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands.
