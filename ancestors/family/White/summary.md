The **White family** lineage represents a significant branch of your ancestry that migrated from the prosperous farming districts of **North Carolina** through **Kentucky** and eventually settled into the **Tennessee-Alabama borderlands**.

### **Early Patriarchs in North Carolina**
*   **Richard White Sr. (c. 1695–1757):** The earliest documented ancestor of this line settled in what was then **Granville County, North Carolina**, around 1747. He established the family near **Fishing Creek** and left his estate to his son, Richard Jr..
*   **Richard White Jr. (c. 1730–1775):** He married **Elizabeth Hudson** (or possibly Elizabeth Gibson) and expanded the family’s landholdings to tracts on **Buffalo Creek** and **Cedar Creek** in Bute (later Warren and Franklin) County. His will named ten children, including your direct ancestor, **John Calvin White Sr.**.

### **The Whitley County, Kentucky Line**
*   **John Calvin White Sr. (c. 1753/1768–1830):** Born in North Carolina, he moved his family to **Whitley County, Kentucky** (then Knox County), around 1798. Known as **"John White Esq.,"** he was a prominent figure and a wealthy planter, owning 300 acres along the **Cumberland River**. He was married three times—to Mary (Unknown), Mary Barber, and **Mary Shelton**.
*   **Dempsey E. White (1798–1859):** The son of John Calvin White Sr. and Mary E. Norris, he served as a member of the **Kentucky Legislature**. He married **Nancy Perkins** in 1819, further connecting the Whites to the prominent **Perkins and Gresham families**. He led the family’s migration from Kentucky to **Hardin County, Tennessee**, around 1843.

### **The Wayne County "Granny Scott" Branch**
*   **Mary Cynthia "Granny" White (1814–1890):** She was the daughter of an **"Unknown Nerbern" [Mewborn]** and likely a son of John Calvin White Sr. (George or Thomas White). Born in Kentucky, she moved to Tennessee and married the widower and **Magistrate John Martin B. Scott**. A revered matriarch, she is the namesake of **Granny Scott Hollow** at 48 Mile Creek in **Wayne County, Tennessee**, noted for her exceptional hospitality.

### **Later Generations and Intermarriages**
*   **James Ervin "Ervie" White (1837/1838–1897):** The son of Dempsey E. White and Nancy Perkins, he was a central figure in the **Hardin County** White line. He married **Lydia Serena Hargrove**, whose parents—**James Monroe Hargrove** and **Serena Welch**—were part of the "western aristocracy" of the Tennessee frontier. Ervie is buried at **Gillis Mills Cemetery** in Hardin County.
*   **Myrtle Blanche White (1893–1986):** The daughter of James Ervin White and Lydia Serena Hargrove, she represents the convergence of the White, Hargrove, and Welch lines. She married **Early Virgil Whitten**, bridging the White family to the Whitten and England lineages.

### **Historical Significance**
The White family members were foundational pioneers in the "regional social ecosystem" of the Tennessee Valley. From legal leadership as **Magistrates and Legislators** to their involvement in the **Revolutionary War** (such as **James Latta**, who served as a substitute for his father), the family was deeply involved in the civic and military development of the American frontier.
