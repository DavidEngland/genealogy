# Research Notes — Mary Cynthia White (White-16150)

## Summary
Mary Cynthia White married John Martin Scott and was associated with the 48 Mile Creek community in Wayne County, Tennessee. Local tradition links her name to “Granny Scott Hollow.” Parentage remains a conflict in compiled records, requiring targeted research in early Wayne County sources.

## Research Questions
1. Is her father Thomas White or George White?
2. Can her mother’s surname (recorded as “Nerbern”) be confirmed as Mewborn/Newborn/Newbern?
3. What primary records connect Mary Cynthia White to the 48 Mile Creek community?

## Findings
- A biographical tradition identifies her as the daughter of George White, an early settler on 48 Mile Creek.
- Compiled records and trees frequently list Thomas White as her father.
- The mother’s surname appears as “Nerbern,” likely a phonetic variant of Mewborn/Newborn/Newbern.
- A location on 48 Mile Creek is reportedly known as “Granny Scott Hollow,” attributed to her.

## Conflicts & Hypotheses
- **Father conflict**: Thomas White vs. George White. This may represent two distinct men with overlapping timelines or a conflation in local histories.
- **Mother’s surname**: “Nerbern” likely derives from the Mewborn/Newborn/Newbern family cluster; requires primary record confirmation.

## Next Actions
- Review Wayne County land, tax, and court records (circa 1810–1840) for White households on 48 Mile Creek.
- Locate any marriage record for Mary Cynthia White and John Martin Scott to confirm parentage or bondsmen.
- Survey probate or estate files for Thomas White or George White that mention Mary Cynthia.
- Check McNairy County cemetery and church records for burial notes or family links.

## Inquiry Letter (Local Historians)
**Subject:** Parentage of Mary Cynthia White Scott (1814–1890) and the History of Granny Scott Hollow

"I am seeking definitive information regarding the parents of **Mary Cynthia White** (1814–1890), wife of Magistrate **John Martin Scott** of **Wayne County, Tennessee**. Genealogical records provided in the sources suggest her father was either **Thomas White** (c. 1780–1840) or **George White**, a foundational settler on **48 Mile Creek**. Her mother is recorded in family trees as '**Unknown Nerbern**' (c. 1780–1840), which appears to be a phonetic variant of the **Mewborn/Newbern/Newborn** surname family system.

I would like to connect with any local residents or historians in the **48 Mile Creek** area who have knowledge of **'Granny Scott Hollow,'** which was reportedly named in her honor. Any documentation or oral history clarifying the relationship between the **Whites** and the **Newborns** in early 19th-century Wayne County would be invaluable."

## Background Notes
- The Mewborn One-Name Study indicates Newbern/Newborn/Mewbourne variants trace to Thomas Mewboorn (c. 1690–1749) in North Carolina.
- Tennessee branches of the family appear in the 1891 Wayne County census listings (Districts 1–2), overlapping White and Scott localities.
- The White family migrated with other pioneer lineages (Cooper, Sims, Lindsey, Pigg) along the Western Highland Rim corridor.

## Social Media Draft (Facebook)
Mary Cynthia (White) Scott (c. 1813–1890) lived along 48 Mile Creek in Wayne County, Tennessee, where local tradition remembers her as the namesake of “Granny Scott Hollow.” She married John Martin Scott, a longtime Wayne County magistrate, and their family helped anchor the area’s early community. I’m researching her parentage—records conflict between Thomas White and George White—and seeking any local sources or family stories that clarify the White/Newborn (Mewborn) connection. If you have information or records from the 48 Mile Creek area, please reach out.
