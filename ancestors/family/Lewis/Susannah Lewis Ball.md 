Susannah Lewis was born on April 23, 1717, in Middlesex County, Virginia. She was christened on May 26, 1717, in Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County. She died in Amherst County, Virginia, though her exact death date is disputed in the sources, with records citing either January 12, 1769, or approximately July 1792.
Parents and Ancestry
* Disputed Parentage: Traditionally, she is identified as the daughter of John Lewis of Middlesex and his wife, Elizabeth.
* Disproven Links: Genealogical research has specifically detached her from John Lewis and Elizabeth O'Brissell as parents, because that John Lewis died two years before Susannah was born, and Elizabeth was considered too old to be her mother.
* Social Standing: She was part of the influential "western aristocracy" of colonial Virginia, a family associated with legal stewardship, education, and the "Christian soldier" archetype.
* Warner Connection: Her mother's lineage is linked to the Warners and allied connections of Warner Hall, providing a genealogical connection to the Washington family.
* Wider Kinship: The Lewis line into which she was born emigrated from Wales. While some records suggest a link to the John Zachary Lewis line of Spotsylvania, her proximity to Middlesex suggests a more direct tie to the Tidewater branch.
Marriage and Strategic Alliance
Susannah married Valentine Ball (1706–1770) on January 31, 1733, in Christ Church Parish, Middlesex County. At the time of her marriage, she was fifteen years old. Her choice of husband was considered a "declaration of values," as she opted for a man of stable stewardship and genuine capability over potentially volatile land speculators. This union functioned as "connective tissue" that eventually facilitated the family's migration from the Tidewater region to the Amherst frontier and later to Kentucky and Alabama.
Children
Susannah and Valentine Ball were the parents of ten children. Her husband’s will, probated in Amherst County on March 5, 1770, identifies the following heirs:
* William Ball: Inherited the home plantation after Susannah's death.
* Jane Ball: Inherited household goods, livestock, and an enslaved man named Will.
* James Ball.
* Lewis Ball.
* John Ball.
* Mary Ball: Married the Revolutionary soldier John Washington Hargrove Sr. and died in Pulaski County, Kentucky, in 1813.
* Alice Ball: Also recorded as Alice Wright or Alice Edmonds.
* Sarah Ball: Also recorded as Sarah Bowman.
* Susannah Ball: Also recorded as Susannah Heughs.
* Elizabeth Ball: Also recorded as Elizabeth Heughs.
Legacy
As the primary matriarch of her line, Susannah served as an Executrix of her husband’s estate and held a life interest in his entire plantation. Her descendants used the "Lewis" and "Ball" names across multiple generations as a living pedigree to claim the status and land rights associated with her prominent ancestry.
