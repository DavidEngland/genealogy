== Biography ==

'''Serena Welch''' (c. 1833 – 1884) was born around 1833 in Hardin County, Tennessee, United States, to Elijah C. Welch (age 23) and Mary Taylor (age 32). She represented the fifth generation of the Welch family in America, descending from Pennsylvania colonists and Scotch-Irish immigrants who settled the Virginia and Tennessee frontiers.

=== Marriage and Family ===

Serena married James Monroe Hargrove (1818–1884) in Hardin County, Tennessee, becoming his second wife following the death of his first wife, Lydia Poole. Through this marriage, she became connected to the distinguished Hargrove-Whitley-Lewis frontier families who were instrumental in settling the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands.

James Monroe Hargrove was the son of Valentine Hargrove (1778–1858), a veteran of the War of 1812 known as a "good warrior," and Ruth Whitley Lewis, daughter of master brickmason Joseph Francis Lewis and Sarah Whitley.

=== Children ===

Serena and James Monroe Hargrove had at least seven children:

1. '''Lydia Serena Hargrove''' (1854–1897)
   * Married James Ervin "Ervie" White on October 1, 1877, in Hardin County, Tennessee
   * This marriage connected the Welch lineage to the White family of wheat farmers in the Shoals region

2. '''Mary Wright (Hargrove) Godwin''' (b. 1856)

3. '''Minerva Jane Hargrove''' (b. 1859)

4. '''Martha Hargrove''' (b. c. 1862)

5. '''Margaret Alice Hargrove''' (b. c. 1864)

6. '''James Columbus Hargrove''' (b. c. 1866)

7. '''Lorenzo Dow Hargrove''' (b. c. 1868)

James Monroe also had children from his first marriage to Lydia Poole, including Ruth Elizabeth Hargrove and William V. Hargrove, making Serena a stepmother to these half-siblings of her own children.

=== Life in Hardin County ===

By 1870, the U.S. Federal Census records show Serena and James Monroe residing in the 3rd Civil District of Hardin County, Tennessee, where James Monroe was engaged in farming. The household also included James Monroe's father, Valentine Hargrove, in his later years, demonstrating the multi-generational family structure common to frontier communities.

Serena lived through the tumultuous Civil War era on the Tennessee-Alabama state line, a region that experienced significant conflict and economic disruption. The Hargrove family maintained their agricultural operations throughout this period, contributing to the post-war recovery of Hardin County.

=== Death and Legacy ===

Serena Welch Hargrove died in 1884 in Hardin County, Tennessee, at approximately 51 years of age. She was buried in Hardin County, though the specific cemetery location requires further research.

Through her daughter Lydia Serena Hargrove, Serena's lineage continued into the White family and eventually connected to the England families of Lauderdale County, Alabama, representing the broader migration patterns of Tennessee families into the Alabama Shoals region.

== Ancestry ==

=== Parents ===

==== Father: Elijah C. Welch (1810–1867) ====

'''Elijah C. Welch''' was born in 1810 in Hopkins County, Kentucky, to Lewis Welch (age 30) and an unknown mother. He migrated to Hardin County, Tennessee, where he established himself as a farmer and raised his family.

The 1850 Hardin County Census lists Elijah as the head of household with Serena enumerated in his family, confirming the parent-child relationship. He died in 1867 in Hardin County, Tennessee, at the age of 57.

==== Mother: Mary Taylor (1801–1880) ====

'''Mary Taylor''' was born in 1801 in South Carolina. Her marriage to Elijah C. Welch brought the Taylor lineage into the Welch family, though specific details about her South Carolina origins require further research.

Mary outlived her husband by 13 years, dying in 1880 in Hardin County, Tennessee, at the age of 79.

=== Grandparents ===

==== Paternal Grandfather: Lewis Welch (b. 1780) ====

'''Lewis Welch''' was born in 1780 in North Carolina to Nicholas Welch (age approximately 42) and Elizabeth E. Moore (age 40). He represented the migration of the Welch family from North Carolina into Kentucky and Tennessee during the early settlement period.

Lewis's connection to the prominent Moore family of Virginia (through his mother) provided important social and economic capital for the family's westward expansion.

==== Paternal Grandmother: [Unknown] ====

Lewis Welch's wife and Serena's paternal grandmother remains unidentified in current records, representing a significant research opportunity for future genealogists.

=== Great-Grandparents ===

==== Great-Grandfather: Nicholas Welch (c. 1738–1814) ====

'''Nicholas Welch''' was born around 1738 in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to John Welch (age approximately 26) and Elizabeth Whiteside. He became a notable figure during the American Revolution, serving as a '''Loyalist Major''' in the Royal British Army.

Nicholas fought at the '''Battle of Ramsour's Mill''' in North Carolina on June 20, 1780, a significant engagement where Loyalist forces under Colonel John Moore were defeated by Patriot militia. Following the British defeat in the Revolution, Nicholas migrated to Tennessee, settling in Giles County where he died in 1814.

His Loyalist service represents an important counterpoint to the predominantly Patriot heritage documented in many Appalachian family lines. The fact that his descendants successfully integrated into Tennessee frontier society demonstrates the eventual reconciliation of Revolutionary-era divisions.

==== Great-Grandmother: Elizabeth E. Moore (1740–1799) ====

'''Elizabeth E. Moore''' was born in 1740, likely in Virginia, to John William Moore, a planter born in 1706 in New Kent, Virginia. She married Nicholas Welch, bringing the influential Moore family lineage into the Welch ancestry.

The Moore family was well-established in Virginia's Tidewater region, with John William Moore owning substantial lands in Hanover County where he died in 1777. Elizabeth's heritage connected the Welch family to Virginia's planter aristocracy.

Elizabeth died in 1799, having witnessed the American Revolution and the early settlement of Tennessee.

=== 2nd Great-Grandparents ===

==== 2nd Great-Grandfather: John Welch (1712–1775) ====

'''John Welch''' was born in 1712 in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, to William Welch (age approximately 32) and Susannah Unknown. He married Elizabeth Whiteside (1717–1742), daughter of Irish immigrants from County Antrim.

John's life in Pennsylvania represented the family's first generation born in America, establishing the foundation for their eventual migration southward through the Great Wagon Road into the Carolinas and Tennessee.

He died in 1775 in Amherst County, Virginia, during the year the American Revolution began.

==== 2nd Great-Grandmother: Elizabeth Whiteside (1717–1742) ====

'''Elizabeth Whiteside''' was born in 1717, daughter of William Whitsitt (born 1689 in County Antrim, Ireland) and an unknown mother. Her father was part of the significant Scotch-Irish immigration to Pennsylvania in the early 18th century.

Elizabeth died young in 1742 in Pennsylvania at the age of 25, leaving her husband John Welch with young children including their son Nicholas.

==== 2nd Great-Grandfather: John William Moore (1706–1777) ====

'''John William Moore''' was a planter born in 1706 in New Kent County, Virginia. He established substantial landholdings in Hanover County, Virginia, where he died in 1777.

Sources within the genealogical record debate whether his wife was Mary Bullock or Mary Susannah Jouett, both associated with influential Virginia families. This uncertainty reflects the incomplete nature of early Virginia records.

=== 3rd Great-Grandparents ===

==== 3rd Great-Grandfather: William Welch (c. 1680–Unknown) ====

'''William Welch''' was born around 1680 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, representing the first generation of the Welch family in America. He married Susannah Unknown.

William's settlement in Lancaster County placed the family in the heart of Pennsylvania's early colonial development, in a region that became known for its diverse immigrant population including Germans, Scotch-Irish, and English Quakers.

==== 3rd Great-Grandmother: Susannah Unknown ====

William Welch's wife remains unidentified, though she was likely of Pennsylvania Dutch or Scotch-Irish origin given the demographic composition of Lancaster County in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

==== 3rd Great-Grandfather: William Whitsitt (1689–Unknown) ====

'''William Whitsitt''' was born in 1689 in County Antrim, Ireland, son of Samuel Whitsitt (born 1664) and Mary Evelyn Calvert (born 1670 in Ireland). He immigrated to America and eventually settled in Amherst, Virginia.

William represented the Scotch-Irish Presbyterian migration to America that profoundly shaped the settlement of the Appalachian frontier. His family brought with them the Presbyterian faith, technical skills, and a fierce independence that characterized Scotch-Irish communities.

=== 4th Great-Grandparents ===

==== 4th Great-Grandfather: Samuel Whitsitt (b. 1664) ====

'''Samuel Whitsitt''' was born in 1664 in Ireland to William Whiteside (born c. 1640 in Antrim, Ireland). He married Mary Evelyn Calvert (born 1670 in Ireland).

==== 4th Great-Grandmother: Mary Evelyn Calvert (b. 1670) ====

'''Mary Evelyn Calvert''' was born in 1670 in Ireland. Her marriage to Samuel Whitsitt continued the Scotch-Irish lineage that eventually produced Serena Welch.

=== 5th Great-Grandfather: William Whiteside (c. 1640–1727) ====

'''William Whiteside''' was born circa 1640 in Antrim, Ireland, and died in 1727. He represents the earliest documented ancestor in the Whiteside/Whitsitt line.

County Antrim was a center of Scottish settlement in Ulster during the Plantation period, and William's family was likely among the Presbyterian Scots who settled there in the early 17th century before later immigrating to America.

== Historical and Geographical Context ==

=== The Scotch-Irish Heritage ===

Serena Welch's ancestry represents the classic pattern of Scotch-Irish settlement in America:

1. **Ulster Origins:** The Whiteside/Whitsitt family originated in County Antrim, Ireland, part of the Ulster Plantation established by Scottish Presbyterians in the 17th century.

2. **Pennsylvania Settlement:** The family immigrated to Pennsylvania in the late 17th/early 18th century, settling in Lancaster and Dauphin Counties among other Scotch-Irish immigrants.

3. **The Great Wagon Road:** By the mid-18th century, the family migrated south through the Shenandoah Valley via the Great Wagon Road, settling in Virginia's Piedmont region (Amherst County).

4. **Revolutionary Era Division:** The family experienced the Revolution from different perspectives—Nicholas Welch served as a Loyalist while many of their Virginia neighbors were Patriots.

5. **Tennessee Frontier:** Following the Revolution, the family migrated to Tennessee (Giles County, then Hardin County), participating in the settlement of the Cumberland and Tennessee River valleys.

=== The Virginia Tidewater Connection ===

Through the Moore family, Serena descended from Virginia's planter class:

* **New Kent County:** The Moore family's origins in this Tidewater county connected Serena to the early colonial Virginia establishment.

* **Hanover County:** John William Moore's move to Hanover County represented the westward expansion of Virginia's plantation economy in the 18th century.

* **Economic Capital:** The Moore family's landholdings provided economic resources that facilitated their descendants' migration to the frontier.

=== Migration Patterns ===

The Welch family history mirrors the broader migration patterns documented in the "Valentine Sagas" and other frontier family narratives:

* **Military Land Warrants:** Like many families, the Welches likely utilized military land grants (from Revolutionary or War of 1812 service) to acquire land in Kentucky and Tennessee.

* **Strategic Marriages:** Marriages connected families across the frontier network—the Welch-Hargrove marriage linked Serena's Pennsylvania-Virginia heritage to the Hargrove family's Kentucky-Tennessee pioneer lineage.

* **Multi-Generational Households:** The 1870 census showing Valentine Hargrove living with James Monroe and Serena reflects the frontier practice of caring for elderly parents while utilizing their knowledge and experience.

=== The Loyalist Legacy ===

Nicholas Welch's service as a Loyalist Major represents an often-overlooked aspect of Appalachian history:

* **Battle of Ramsour's Mill:** This June 1780 engagement was one of several conflicts in the Carolina backcountry between Loyalist and Patriot militias.

* **Post-War Reconciliation:** Despite his Loyalist service, Nicholas successfully settled in Tennessee, demonstrating that Revolutionary-era divisions eventually healed on the frontier.

* **Family Integration:** His descendants married into Patriot families (the Hargroves descended from Revolutionary War veteran John Washington Hargrove Sr.), showing complete integration within a generation.

== Research Notes ==

=== Surname Variations ===

Researchers should be aware of spelling variations for the Whiteside family:

* Whiteside
* Whitsitt
* Whitsett
* Whitesides

All variations appear to represent the same family line from County Antrim, Ireland.

=== Key Records and Locations ===

* **Birth:** c. 1833, Hardin County, Tennessee
* **Marriage:** Hardin County, Tennessee to James Monroe Hargrove
* **Residence:** 3rd Civil District, Hardin County, Tennessee (1870 Census)
* **Death:** 1884, Hardin County, Tennessee (age c. 51)
* **Burial:** Hardin County, Tennessee (specific cemetery unknown)

=== Unresolved Research Questions ===

1. **Maternal Grandmother:** The identity of Elijah C. Welch's mother (wife of Lewis Welch) remains unknown.

2. **Moore Family Debate:** Sources conflict on whether John William Moore married Mary Bullock or Mary Susannah Jouett—further Virginia records research needed.

3. **Burial Location:** Serena's specific cemetery in Hardin County has not been identified.

4. **Mary Taylor Origins:** Details about Serena's mother's South Carolina family remain to be discovered.
