My great-great grandmother was a MacDonald, she married my great-great grandfather William England.  Her dad was Thomas Anderson MacDonald.

Below is some information I have found on the MacDonald family in America.  They were written by a cousin, William Lindsey England.  My great aunt Lois England Henderson was very close to William Lindsey England and they shared family information.

It is with Fear and trembling that I attempt to list the names of
the kind and generous friends and kin who have helped me with
this record of our family.
I'm so aware of my forgetfulness and
shortcomings and I'm afraid that I will leave out a name of a soul
who has been helpful. I pray that there are no errors, but,
I, nevertheless, make this quote from Jung:
"Knowledge rests not
upon the truth alone, but upon error also."
With a tender caution

## JOHN MCDONALD ([WikiTree search](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:SearchPerson&wpFirstName=John&wpLastName=McDonald&wpBirthDate=1792))

1792 - c.1860
John McDonald, born about 1792 in South Carolina, was my Great-
Great Grandfather, and, we think, the first of our family to settle
in Lauderdale County, Alabama. Some sources list him as "John
W. McDonald," however, I have not been able to verify the "W."
He arrived at Green Hill, Alabama, in 1834, from Tennessee.
According to information that I found in the State Archives at
Montgomery (written by Stephen McDonald who served as Representative
from Lauderdale County in 1919 - and who was a son of my Great-Great
Uncle Joseph Emory McDonald) the following events occurred in our
family's move from South Carolina through Tennessee and eventually
to Alabama:
John W. McDonald and wife, Margaret Emory McDonald, left South
Carolina in 1792*and settled at Wartrace, Tennessee. Tney came
to Lauderdale County, Alabama, in 1834, and settled on Cow Pen
Creek near Green Hill in Lauderdale County.
(* I think this date is not correct in that our John McDonald
was born about that same year in South Carolina. Another note
of interest is that John's son, Elias, was born in Bedford County,
Tennessee, in 1819.
John's oldest son, Amos, was born in South
Carolina in 1816. These two births indicate that our McDonalds,
perhaps, left South Carolina sometime between 1816 and 1819. Seven
children were born in Tennessee: Matthew J., Thomas Anderson,
Joseph Emory, Lavenia Syrena, Flavis and Altina. The youngest,
John Scruggs McDonald, was born at Green Hill in 1834, the same
year our family arrived in Alabama.)
John McDonald was married to [Margaret Emory](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:SearchPerson&wpFirstName=Margaret&wpLastName=Emory&wpBirthDate=1793), who was born in South
Carolina about 1793. Although we have no proof as yet, we
believe that Margaret was a daughter of Stephen Emory of Laurens
County, South Carolina, who died between 1787 and 1798 (The
inventory of his estate was dated March 15, 1797.) A daughter
named Margaret was listed among these early records. The spelling
for Emory is shown three or four ways in these early records:
Embrey, Embree, Emmory, and Embry.* Great-Great Grandmother's maiden
name, Emory, was used by her descendants in almost every generation,
sometimes as Embrey, Emory, or Embry. Also, the name Stephen has
been used over and over in our family genealogy.
In fact, one of
John and Margaret's grandsons was named Stephen Emory McDonald.
My Grandfather Will McDonald and his brother, Jones Emory McDonald,
remembered that their two bachelor uncles by the name of Emory
once operated a general store at Brandon Factory near where my
Grandfather McDonald was born on Cypress Creek. Uncle Jones
Emory McDonald added that they were rather prosperous and had
been investors in an early railroad linking the iron ore mines
at Iron City, Tennessee, to Florence. He would point out the
old railroad bed that was cut for that purpose across the creek
from where their store was located. He said the Railroad
Methodist Church was named for this early railway.
I have
not been able to find anything about these two brothers in
the census or land records in our county. Yet, with much interest
» Also spelled as "Hembree" in early family.

I discovered a rough map of the Cypress Creek area of Lauderdale
County in the papers of General John Coffee at the University of
North Alabama Library. This map, although not dated, was perhaps
drawn in the early 1830s based upon the location of certain early
landmarks on the map. In Township 2, Range 11, and on the main
stream of Cypress Creek an Embree Factory is clearly designated.
This location is at what we now call White's Lake - the exact place
my Grandfather and his brother pointed to as where their uncles
owned a general store. Perhaps the owners of this Embree Factory
were either brothers or uncles to our ancestor Margaret Emory
McDonald.
According to my friend, the late Dr. Maurice Wade Pruitt, There were
two serious economic depressions in upper South Carolina during
the early part of the Nineteenth Century, the first in 1816 and
the other in 1834. Large numbers of families migrated into the
area around Cornersvi1le, Tennessee (in what is now Giles County.)
Dr. Pruitt said that the settlers (made up of people from Union,
Abbeville, Laurens and Newberry Districts in South Carolina)
crossed the Savannah River near Anderson, South Carolina, and
came by way of Athens, Georgia, to Chattanooga. At Chattanooga they
loaded their belongings into flat boats and proceeded down the
Tennessee River to the mouth of Elk River. Here they divided, and
some went up the Elk to Cornersvi1le. A number of families,
including the Ducketts, Fowlers, and others, settled in and
around what is now called Cloverdale in Lauderdale County, Alabama.
Dr. Pruett's account follows what is known as the "Migration Patterns
of the South" when great wagon trains left North Carolina and traveled
east of the mountains and south into South Carolina, across
Georgia, and into Tennessee and Alabama.
I do not know if or how
this relates to our McDonalds, other than they apparently left
South Carolina during the 1816 economic depression to make their
way into Tennessee and then to Alabama.
It is important for future genealogists in our family to know
that there were two groups of McDonalds around Green Hill in the
early days. One set came from North Carolina and seemed to have
been closely associated with the Kennedys and the Kennedy Gun
Factory. Our John, as mentioned, was from South Carolina. Yet,
his sons were blacksmiths and gunsmiths. Tradition tells us that
he was, too, although he is listed as a farmer in the 1850 Census.
They surely had to have had early connections with the Kennedys
and their gun works. To make matters even more confusing, there
were at least three John McDonalds and two Amos McDonalds living
in and around Green Hill. Our John and Amos listed their birthplace
as South Carolina. Courthouse records show that one John McDonald
was married to Malinda Chisholm on January 5, 1830. Another John
McDonald was married to Jane Brown in January 1832. Our John and
Margaret were married prior to settling at Green Hill. The North
Carolina Amous McDonald (born in April 1829,) was married to Nancy
McDougal. This Amos, or Amous, died at Van Zandt County, Mississippi,
in 1905. Our Amos McDonald, born in 1816 in South Carolina, was
married to Nancy Hamm. Future family historians Are cautioned
that our McDonalds Are listed as "McDaniels" in both the 1850
Lauderdale County, Alabama, and 1860 Lawrence County, Tennessee,

Census Reports. This is most likely an error on the part of two
census-takers. However, when one delves deeply into our Celtic
history, he finds that McDonalds and McDaniels are as one in the
great Clan Donald.
I don't know how, or if, these several groups of McDonalds at
Green Hill were connected. My friend, the late William Q. Hill,
knew Fernando Socrates "Uncle Bud" McDonald, and talked with him
numbers of times. Uncle Bud told Hill that the South and North
Carolina McDonalds at Green Hill were related; however, there was
bad blood between them, going all the way back to the Revolutionary
War when one group sided with the Colonies and the other with
England.
Another item of interest in our family history is the February,
1843, estate settlement of [Ephraim B. McDonald](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:SearchPerson&wpFirstName=Ephraim%20B.&wpLastName=McDonald), a gunsmith at Green
Hill, who was born in North Carolina. Cousin Dan Wallace, a
professional gun collector and historian, tells me that there is no
doubt but that Ephraim had close connections with the Kennedy
rifles, based upon a study of one of Ephraim's guns. John McDonald
was listed as the administrator of Ephraim's estate. A number
of our McDonalds were listed as buyers of Ephraim's gun—making
tools: Matthew, Thomas Anderson, John, Elias, and Joseph.
Ephraim's widow was Rachel LaFan. He was married to her on
August 6, 1840, and she was, perhaps, his second wife. They
had three children: Thursey, Henry Clay, and Thadeus. Rachel
later remarried, this time to John Lawson. A descendent of Thursey
McDonald and a descendant of one of Lawsons listed Ephraim B.
McDonald as the oldest son of our John and Margaret Emory McDonald.
Another family historian listed Ephraim as a brother to our John
McDonald. Still another interesting connection is that the
fourth son of Matthew J. McDonald was given the name of Ephraim
McDonald II. (Matthew was a son of John and Margaret Emory McDonald.)
There is no question in my mind but that old Ephraim B. McDonald is
a member of our clan, but I do not yet know how he is related.
This
gives, yet, another dimension to the question about the relationship
between the North and South Carolina McDonalds of Green Hill.
John and Margaret Emory McDonald remained in Lauderdale County
less than twenty years, and by I860 were back in Tennessee.
There is a December 1854, Land Indenture recorded in the Lauderdale
County, Alabama, by John McDonald to Duncan Stewart involving 240
acres in Township 1, Range 9. This land lies between Green Hill
and Center Hill. John would have been around 62 years of age and
Margaret about 61 at the time. This transaction occurred about
four years after their son Joseph Emory McDonald purchased his Cow
Pen farm (and site of his blacksmith shop) from the Milner family.
The sale of the Lauderdale County farm in 1854 may, in fact, be
the year our John and Margaret moved to Wayland Springs,
Tennessee, as they show up in the 1860 Lawrence County, Tennessee
Census. Their daughter, Lavenia Syrena, age 33 years, was living
with her parents in the 1860 Census. Lawrence County records show
her marriage on October 29, 1863, to James Marcum. Perhaps, this
daughter, then considered an old maid, was taking care of her aging parents, and, perhaps, following their deaths she was free to
marry James Marcum. Perhaps, James Marcum was a widower with
children, and perhaps needed a wife. This type of "convenient"
marriage occurred quite often in earlier times. Another event of
interest is that John and Margaret had a son, Anderson McDonald,
who was married at Wayland Springs. Perhaps this son Anderson had
some influence in his parent's move to Wayland Springs.
The 1880 Lawrence County Census does not show our John or Margaret.
Therefore, it is assumed that they died between I860 and 1880 and
Are buried in one of the cemeteries in that AreA.
As far as is known John and Margaret McDonald had at least nine
or, maybe, ten children. These sons and daughters and their
families will be described in the narrative to follow.

### AMOS MCDONALD ([WikiTree search](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:SearchPerson&wpFirstName=Amos&wpLastName=McDonald&wpBirthDate=1816))

1816 - c.1870
I'm listing Amos McDonald as the oldest child. Sometimes spelled
as "Amous," he was born in South Carolina in 1816, at the time
his father, John, would have been about 24 years o+ age. Although
I'm now agreeing with other family genealogists that Amos was a son ••
of John and Margaret, I do not remember hearing him mentioned by
either my Grandfather or my Great—Uncle Jones Emory McDonald, nor
was Amos listed by Marshall McDonald, grandson of Elias McDonald.
Prior to Cousin Marshall's death in 1976, at the age of 91 years,
he made a list of his grandfather Elias McDonald's family which
is now in the possession of his daughter, Cleo Wilson. My Grand-
father did say, however, that we were km to the Hamms. in that
Amos was married to Nancy Hamm, it does seem to agree with Grandpa's
recollections.
In old Celtic ways, the names of children lend good
clues, in that the same names Are often repeated through a numder of
generations. Two of Amos's children were "Spinks" and "Carroll,"
which sound familiar in our McDonald family.
Incidentally, I have
a record that shows two McDonalds — John and Amos - operating a
grist mill on Richardson Creek near Green Hill following the Civil
War. This could be the Richardson Mill recently painted from an
old photograph by my friend, John Wesley Morgan.
There were two Amos McDonalds at Green Hill.
The 1850 census
shows the Amos born in South Carolina to be 34 years of age in
1850, and the one born in North Carolina as 21 years old.
The
South Carolina Amos (whom we claim for our family) was married to
[Nancy Hamm](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:SearchPerson&wpFirstName=Nancy&wpLastName=Hamm) on September 1, 1836. The North Carolina Amos
(perhaps named [Archibald Amos McDonald](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:SearchPerson&wpFirstName=Archibald%20Amos&wpLastName=McDonald)) was married February 11, 1849, to
[Nancy C. McDougal](https://www.wikitree.com/index.php?title=Special:SearchPerson&wpFirstName=Nancy%20C.&wpLastName=McDougal). This North Carolina Amos, or Amous, died at
Van Zandt County, Mississippi, in 1905. Our Amos McDonald, born in 1816 in South Carolina, was
married to Nancy Hamm. Future family historians Are cautioned
that our McDonalds Are listed as "McDaniels" in both the 1850
Lauderdale County, Alabama, and 1860 Lawrence County, Tennessee,
