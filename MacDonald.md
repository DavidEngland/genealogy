My great-great grandmother was a MacDonald, she married my great-great grandfather William England.  Her dad was Thomas Anderson MacDonald.

Below is some information I have found on the MacDonald family in America.  They were written by a cousin, William Lindsey England.  My great aunt Lois England Henderson was very close to William Lindsey England and they shared family information.

It is with Fear and trembling that I attempt to list the names of
the kind and generous friends and kin who have helped me with
this record of our family.
I'm so aware of my forgetfulness and
shortcomings and I'm afraid that I will leave out a name of a soul
who has been helpful. I pray that there are no errors, but,
I, nevertheless, make this quote from Jung:
"Knowledge rests not
upon the truth alone, but upon error also."
With a tender caution
I hereby publish the list of those who have assisted in the research
of our McDonalds:

## JOHN MCDONALD

1792 - c.1860
John McDonald, born about 1792 in South Carolina, was my Great-
Great Grandfather, and, we think, the first of our family to settle
in Lauderdale County, Alabama. Some sources list him as "John
W. McDonald," however, I have not been able to verify the "W."
He arrived at Green Hill, Alabama, in 1834, from Tennessee.
According to information that I found in the State Archives at
Montgomery (written by Stephen McDonald who served as Representative
from Lauderdale County in 1919 - and who was a son of my Great-Great
Uncle Joseph Emory McDonald) the following events occurred in our
family's move from South Carolina through Tennessee and eventually
to Alabama:
John W. McDonald and wife, Margaret Emory McDonald, left South
Carolina in 1792*and settled at Wartrace, Tennessee. Tney came
to Lauderdale County, Alabama, in 1834, and settled on Cow Pen
Creek near Green Hill in Lauderdale County.
(* I think this date is not correct in that our John McDonald
was born about that same year in South Carolina. Another note
of interest is that John's son, Elias, was born in Bedford County,
Tennessee, in 1819.
John's oldest son, Amos, was born in South
Carolina in 1816. These two births indicate that our McDonalds,
perhaps, left South Carolina sometime between 1816 and 1819. Seven
children were born in Tennessee: Matthew J., Thomas Anderson,
Joseph Emory, Lavenia Syrena, Flavis and Altina. The youngest,
John Scruggs McDonald, was born at Green Hill in 1834, the same
year our family arrived in Alabama.)
John McDonald was married to Margaret Emory, who was born in South
Carolina about 1793. Although we have no proof as yet, we
believe that Margaret was a daughter of Stephen Emory of Laurens
County, South Carolina, who died between 1787 and 1798 (The
inventory of his estate was dated March 15, 1797.) A daughter
named Margaret was listed among these early records. The spelling
for Emory is shown three or four ways in these early records:
Embrey, Embree, Emmory, and Embry.* Great-Great Grandmother's maiden
name, Emory, was used by her descendants in almost every generation,
sometimes as Embrey, Emory, or Embry. Also, the name Stephen has
been used over and over in our family genealogy.
In fact, one of
John and Margaret's grandsons was named Stephen Emory McDonald.
My Grandfather Will McDonald and his brother, Jones Emory McDonald,
remembered that their two bachelor uncles by the name of Emory
once operated a general store at Brandon Factory near where my
Grandfather McDonald was born on Cypress Creek. Uncle Jones
Emory McDonald added that they were rather prosperous and had
been investors in an early railroad linking the iron ore mines
at Iron City, Tennessee, to Florence. He would point out the
old railroad bed that was cut for that purpose across the creek
from where their store was located. He said the Railroad
Methodist Church was named for this early railway.
I have
not been able to find anything about these two brothers in
the census or land records in our county. Yet, with much interest
» Also spelled as "Hembree" in early family.

I discovered a rough map of the Cypress Creek area of Lauderdale
County in the papers of General John Coffee at the University of
North Alabama Library. This map, although not dated, was perhaps
drawn in the early 1830s based upon the location of certain early
landmarks on the map. In Township 2, Range 11, and on the main
stream of Cypress Creek an Embree Factory is clearly designated.
This location is at what we now call White's Lake - the exact place
my Grandfather and his brother pointed to as where their uncles
owned a general store. Perhaps the owners of this Embree Factory
were either brothers or uncles to our ancestor Margaret Emory
McDonald.
According to my friend, the late Dr. Maurice Wade Pruitt, There were
two serious economic depressions in upper South Carolina during
the early part of the Nineteenth Century, the first in 1816 and
the other in 1834. Large numbers of families migrated into the
area around Cornersvi1le, Tennessee (in what is now Giles County.)
Dr. Pruitt said that the settlers (made up of people from Union,
Abbeville, Laurens and Newberry Districts in South Carolina)
crossed the Savannah River near Anderson, South Carolina, and
came by way of Athens, Georgia, to Chattanooga. At Chattanooga they
loaded their belongings into flat boats and proceeded down the
Tennessee River to the mouth of Elk River. Here they divided, and
some went up the Elk to Cornersvi1le. A number of families,
including the Ducketts, Fowlers, and others, settled in and
around what is now called Cloverdale in Lauderdale County, Alabama.
Dr. Pruett's account follows what is known as the "Migration Patterns
of the South" when great wagon trains left North Carolina and traveled
east of the mountains and south into South Carolina, across
Georgia, and into Tennessee and Alabama.
I do not know if or how
this relates to our McDonalds, other than they apparently left
South Carolina during the 1816 economic depression to make their
way into Tennessee and then to Alabama.
It is important for future genealogists in our family to know
that there were two groups of McDonalds around Green Hill in the
early days. One set came from North Carolina and seemed to have
been closely associated with the Kennedys and the Kennedy Gun
Factory. Our John, as mentioned, was from South Carolina. Yet,
his sons were blacksmiths and gunsmiths. Tradition tells us that
he was, too, although he is listed as a farmer in the 1850 Census.
They surely had to have had early connections with the Kennedys
and their gun works. To make matters even more confusing, there
were at least three John McDonalds and two Amos McDonalds living
in and around Green Hill. Our John and Amos listed their birthplace
as South Carolina. Courthouse records show that one John McDonald
was married to Malinda Chisholm on January 5, 1830. Another John
McDonald was married to Jane Brown in January 1832. Our John and
Margaret were married prior to settling at Green Hill. The North
Carolina Amous McDonald (born in April 1829,) was married to Nancy
McDougal. This Amos, or Amous, died at Van Zandt County, Mississippi,
in 1905. Our Amos McDonald, born in 1816 in South Carolina, was
married to Nancy Hamm. Future family historians Are cautioned
that our McDonalds Are listed as "McDaniels" in both the 1850
Lauderdale County, Alabama, and 1860 Lawrence County, Tennessee,

Census Reports. This is most likely an error on the part of two
census-takers. However, when one delves deeply into our Celtic
history, he finds that McDonalds and McDaniels are as one in the
great Clan Donald.
I don't know how, or if, these several groups of McDonalds at
Green Hill were connected. My friend, the late William Q. Hill,
knew Fernando Socrates "Uncle Bud" McDonald, and talked with him
numbers of times. Uncle Bud told Hill that the South and North
Carolina McDonalds at Green Hill were related; however, there was
bad blood between them, going all the way back to the Revolutionary
War when one group sided with the Colonies and the other with
England.
Another item of interest in our family history is the February,
1843, estate settlement of Ephraim B. McDonald, a gunsmith at Green
Hill, who was born in North Carolina. Cousin Dan Wallace, a
professional gun collector and historian, tells me that there is no
doubt but that Ephraim had close connections with the Kennedy
rifles, based upon a study of one of Ephraim's guns. John McDonald
was listed as the administrator of Ephraim's estate. A number
of our McDonalds were listed as buyers of Ephraim's gun—making
tools: Matthew, Thomas Anderson, John, Elias, and Joseph.
Ephraim's widow was Rachel LaFan. He was married to her on
August 6, 1840, and she was, perhaps, his second wife. They
had three children: Thursey, Henry Clay, and Thadeus. Rachel
later remarried, this time to John Lawson. A descendent of Thursey
McDonald and a descendant of one of Lawsons listed Ephraim B.
McDonald as the oldest son of our John and Margaret Emory McDonald.
Another family historian listed Ephraim as a brother to our John
McDonald. Still another interesting connection is that the
fourth son of Matthew J. McDonald was given the name of Ephraim
McDonald II. (Matthew was a son of John and Margaret Emory McDonald.)
There is no question in my mind but that old Ephraim B. McDonald is
a member of our clan, but I do not yet know how he is related.
This
gives, yet, another dimension to the question about the relationship
between the North and South Carolina McDonalds of Green Hill.
John and Margaret Emory McDonald remained in Lauderdale County
less than twenty years, and by I860 were back in Tennessee.
There is a December 1854, Land Indenture recorded in the Lauderdale
County, Alabama, by John McDonald to Duncan Stewart involving 240
acres in Township 1, Range 9. This land lies between Green Hill
and Center Hill. John would have been around 62 years of age and
Margaret about 61 at the time. This transaction occurred about
four years after their son Joseph Emory McDonald purchased his Cow
Pen farm (and site of his blacksmith shop) from the Milner family.
The sale of the Lauderdale County farm in 1854 may, in fact, be
the year our John and Margaret moved to Wayland Springs,
Tennessee, as they show up in the 1860 Lawrence County, Tennessee
Census. Their daughter, Lavenia Syrena, age 33 years, was living
with her parents in the 1860 Census. Lawrence County records show
her marriage on October 29, 1863, to James Marcum. Perhaps, this
daughter, then considered an old maid, was taking care of her aging parents, and, perhaps, following their deaths she was free to
marry James Marcum. Perhaps, James Marcum was a widower with
children, and perhaps needed a wife. This type of "convenient"
marriage occurred quite often in earlier times. Another event of
interest is that John and Margaret had a son, Anderson McDonald,
who was married at Wayland Springs. Perhaps this son Anderson had
some influence in his parent's move to Wayland Springs.
The 1880 Lawrence County Census does not show our John or Margaret.
Therefore, it is assumed that they died between I860 and 1880 and
Are buried in one of the cemeteries in that AreA.
As far as is known John and Margaret McDonald had at least nine
or, maybe, ten children. These sons and daughters and their
families will be described in the narrative to follow.

### AMOS MCDONALD

1816 - c.1870
I'm listing Amos McDonald as the oldest child. Sometimes spelled
as "Amous," he was born in South Carolina in 1816, at the time
his father, John, would have been about 24 years o+ age. Although
I'm now agreeing with other family genealogists that Amos was a son ••
of John and Margaret, I do not remember hearing him mentioned by
either my Grandfather or my Great—Uncle Jones Emory McDonald, nor
was Amos listed by Marshall McDonald, grandson of Elias McDonald.
Prior to Cousin Marshall's death in 1976, at the age of 91 years,
he made a list of his grandfather Elias McDonald's family which
is now in the possession of his daughter, Cleo Wilson. My Grand-
father did say, however, that we were km to the Hamms. in that
Amos was married to Nancy Hamm, it does seem to agree with Grandpa's
recollections.
In old Celtic ways, the names of children lend good
clues, in that the same names Are often repeated through a numder of
generations. Two of Amos's children were "Spinks" and "Carroll,"
which sound familiar in our McDonald family.
Incidentally, I have
a record that shows two McDonalds — John and Amos - operating a
grist mill on Richardson Creek near Green Hill following the Civil
War. This could be the Richardson Mill recently painted from an
old photograph by my friend, John Wesley Morgan.
There were two Amos McDonalds at Green Hill.
The 1850 census
shows the Amos born in South Carolina to be 34 years of age in
1850, and the one born in North Carolina as 21 years old.
The
South Carolina Amos (whom we claim for our family) was married to
Nancy Hamm on September 1, 1836. The North Carolina Amos
(perhaps named Archibald Amos) was married February 11, 1849, to
Nancy C. McDougai. This North Carolina Amos, or Amous, died at
Van Zandt, Mississippi, in 1905.
The 1850 Census shows our Amos and Nancy Hamm McDonald with
the following six children:

1. William R. McDonald was born in 1838.
2. Mary McDonald was born in 1840.
3. Sarah McDonald was born in 1842.
4. Spinks McDonald was born in 1844.
5. James McDonald was born in 1846.
6. Carroll McDonald was born in 1848.
This Amos McDonald appears in the 1880 census without his wife,
Nancy, who probably was deceased. However, his third child, Sarah,
was living in the house (at the age of 37, which agrees with her
age as shown in 1850.) In addition, five young children are shown
in Amos' household, whom I am not able to identify unless, perhaps,
they were Sarah's children. These five were listed as:
7. Nancy A. McDonald, born in 1368.
8. Franklin W. McDonald, born in 1873.
9. Eliza A. MmcDonald, born in 1875.
10. Jinny Lee McDonald, born in 1877.
11. Wiley E. McDonald, born in 1879.

### MATTHEW J. McDONALD

1817 - 1906
Matthew J. McDonald (born 1817 in Tennessee and died in 1906) is
shown as the second child. He was married to Rhoda Lapon (also
shown as "Lasson," which I suspect is true in that the old way of
writing a double S was by using what appeared to be a strange—looking
" P"; also, it could have been "Lawson.") Matthew and Rhoda had
at least five children:

1. Marilla McDonald (born 1840)
2. George McDonald (born 1841)
3. Matthew McDonald (born 1845)
4. Ephram McDonald II (born 1847)
5. Rebecca McDonald (born 1850)
ELiAS M. MCDONALD
1819 - 1897
Elias M. McDonald, known as "Lias," is the third child. He was
born July 25, 1819, at Wartrace, Bedford County, Tennessee, and died
September 29, 1897, at St. Joseph, Lawrence County, Tennessee, with
burial in the Holland Cemetery. He had the reputation of being
an outstanding gunsmith and produced what was called the "Kentucky
Rifle" at his blacksmith shop near Green Hill. He was one of
the buyers of gun—manufacturing tools and supplies from the
estate of Ephraim McDonald who died prior to the Civil War.
(Ephraim was also a well—known gunsmith and it is said that one
of Ephraim's guns is owed by a collector in North Carolina and
it has been appraised at $ 7,000.)
Elias' grandson, Marshall McDonald, inherited one of the long
rifles from his father, Fernanda. One of Marshall's sons, Neal,
told me that he and his brothers, while playing with this rifle
over a number of years, did, in fact, destroy it. He described
it as "having either a hexagon or an octagon—shaped barrel with a
trigger guard made from polished brass." Wynel1 Ann Davis, who
lives at Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, is a great—granddaughter of Elias
McDonald. She inherited the ledger from his blacksmith shop and
graciously allowed me to make copies of it. This ledger has
entries made by Elias. His penmanship was excellent, indicating
that he had a good education for his time. The late William Q.
Hill, Green Hill historian, told me that "old Elias McDonald was
very keen on education and sent his son, Fernanda, to the college
at Florence (now the University of North Alabama) and two of his
daughters were educated in Tennessee." Elias' obituary in the
local paper showed that he was one of the oldest members of the
Green Hill Mason Lodge.
Elias built and repaired buggies, wagons, and coaches in his shop
and did much of the c a r r i A q e repair for the Holland Inn. Entries
in his ledger also show that he made caskets, sharpened plows and
hoes, and sold bacon and other items. A newspaper, THE LAUDERDALE
TIMES, reported in its June 14, 1872, edition:
"The wood and iron shop by Mr. E. M. McDonald is crowded
with work... while examining the buggy, every part of
which was made by Esquire McDonald, it is not only substantial, but really handsome ... as well put up a
job as could be obtained outside a city."
Elias owned three hundred acres of land on both sides o+ the
old Jackson Military Road (now called Roaches Creek Road)
north of Green Hill. Here, in 1854, he built his home which
was located directly across from the Holland Stage Coach Inn.
Elias constructed his two—story house using poplar logs. He
placed his fireplace in the center of the house so that the
rooms on both sides could be heated. (Historians refer to
this style of structure as a "Saddle—bag Log House.") One of
Elias' great—grandsons remembered that his Aunt Mattie
McDonald's room was upstairs. He also said that Noah and
Lou Hill were the last people to live there before it burned
a number of years ago.
Elias was married July 11, 1843, to Ellen Elmira Ross. She was
born November 30, 1820, in Edgefield County, Tennessee, and died
March 10, 1904, ar>d is buried in the Holland Cemetery. Her
father was born in Scotland. Elias and Ellen McDonald had six
children:
6. Mary Eudora McDonald, known as "Dora," was born July 15,
7. She was married to George Forsythe who owned and
operated a planning mill and lumber company at Iron City,
Tennessee. At one time the Forsythes operated the mam
hotel in that town. I've been confused about Dora all my
life in that my Grandfather McDonald referred to her
as "Aunt Dora". He lived for a number of years with the
Forsythes and worked for them in the planning mill.
Grandpa's half—brother, James Francis McDonald, was working
for the Forsythes at Iron City when he was run over and
killed by a tram on the trestle at nearby Pruitton, Alabama.
Cousin Dora Forsythe died August 30, 1920, and is buried
in the historic Tabernacle Methodist Cemetery at Green Hill.
She and George Forsythe had six children:
— John Moore Forsythe (born QctoPer 3, 1869, and died
March 26, 1933, and buried in Mt. Nebo Cemetery, Lawrence
County, Tennessee.) His wife, Martha Atlanta "APbie"
Killen, was a daughter of Dr. Duncan and Elizabeth
Robinson Killen. Abbie was born September 4, 1872,
and died June 13, 1960, with burial at Mt. Nebo.
John and Abbie had four children:
o Mamie Forsythe, born September 14, 1891, in
Green Hill, and died June 18, 1924, with burial
at Mt. Nebo. Mamie was married to Richard C.
Hoilis.
o Willie Forsythe, born January 23, 1896, at
St. Joseph, Tennessee. She was married to
Howard I. Carroll on December 27, 1921.
o Floyd Forsythe, born July 2, 1898, in Lauderdale
County, and died May 7, 1960, m Columbia,
Tennessee, and buried at Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.
On February 24, 1925, Floyd was married to Mary Parkes.

o Ruby Forsythe, born July 13, 1909, in Iron City,
Tennessee, was married July 1, 1926, in Pulaski,
Tennessee, to Roy Hensley.
Edgar Lee Forsythe was born June 1, 1871, and died
January 31, 1938. He was married to Annie LaFan. They
Are buried in the LaFan Cemetery in Lawrence County,
Tennessee, also known as Shiloh Cemetery. Edgar Lee
and Annie had four children:
o Raymond Forsythe
o Myrtle Forsythe
o Howard Forsythe
o Beaumont Forsythe who was a well-known businessman
at Sheffield, Alabama. Beaumont owned and operated
the Smokehouse Pool Room and Restaurant in that
city for many years.
Rebecca Josephine "Josie" Forsythe was born September 23,
1874, and died January 27, 1952. She was married
August 14, 1892, to Thomas Henderson Thornton Senior
who was born in 1871 and died June 28, 1902. Josie
and Tom Are buried in the Richardson's Chapel Cemetery
near Green Hill. The Thornton homeplace was located
on the road that connects Roaches Creek Road to
Richardson's Chapel. Their farm was behind the
old Elias McDonald Place. Josie and Tom had four children:
o Edgar Newton Thornton, born May 23, 1893, and
died November 21, 1975. He was married August
21, 1918, to Ethel Tidwell.
o Bertie Bryant "Bert" Thornton, born October 11,
1896, was married March 23, 1919, to Vela
Chandler.
o Mary Eula Thornton, born August 9, 1899, and
died October 18, 1971, was married October 16,
1920, to Terry Eugene Campbell,
o Thomas Henderson Thornton Junior, born October
9, 1902, was married July 1, 1923, to Clara
Newman.
(Note: One of Cousin Josie's grandsons was Allan
Thornton, a long—time Superintendant of
Education for Lauderdale County. The Allen
Thornton School at Center Star is named
for him.)
Edna Earl Forsythe was born August 9, 1877, and was
married to Luke Willis.
Leo McDonald Forsythe Senior was born April 16, 1880, and
died June 4, 1953, and buried at Mt. Nebo. He was
married to Una Ora Killen, daughter of Doctor Duncan
Killen and his wife Elizabeth Robinson Killen. Una
was born in 1883, and died June 6, 1930. Leo and Una
had five children:
o Ottis Forsythe, born March 8, 1902, and was married to Boma Hardwick.

o Carrie Beatrice Forsythe, born March 8, 1905, and
died January 13, 1913, and buried at Mt. Nebo.
o Algie Forsythe, born May 18, 1908, and died
February 12, 1985, and buried at Mt. Nebo.
Algie was married May 4, 1930, to Gladys Myrtle
Hensley.
o Leo McDonald Forsythe Junior was born October 2,
1914, at Collinwood, Tennessee. I worked with Leo
a number of years when 1 was first employed with 1VA.
After he left TVA in 1957, Leo was appointed to the
Tennessee Building Commission at Nashville,
o Wilson Forsythe was born Hay 14, 1918, at Wayland
Springs, Tennessee, and died in 1940 and is buried
at Mt. Nebo Cemetery.
2. Alonzo C. McDonald was born June 27, 1846, in Lauderdale
County, and died March 23, 1865.
3. Fernanda Socrates McDonald, known as "Uncle Bud," was the
third child of my Great-Great Uncle Elias. He was born
February 26, 1848. Too young to serve as a soldier in
the Civil War, Uncle Bud, at the age of 16 years,
volunteered in 1864, as an ambulance driver for the Union
Army, and served in and around Columbia, Tennessee. Among
the things he brought home after the war included a
U.S. Army saddle, sword, .44 caliber revolver, and a
horse brush. His grandson, Neal McDonald of Memphis,
inherited the saddle, sword, and brush. Neal told me that
his grandfather sold the pistol to Willie Thigpen who
was then Sheriff of Lawrence County, Tennessee.
Uncle Bud was married to his next door neighbor, Lydia
Harrison Holland, daughter of Harrison Holland and
Isabelle Wiley Holland, owners of the Holland Inn located
on the old Jackson Military Road (now the Roaches Creek
Road) between Green Hill, Alabama and St. Joseph, Tennessee.
Lydia was born November 15, 1852, at Lawrence County,
Tennessee, and died December 18, 1932. She is buried
in the St. Joseph, Tennessee, Cemetery.
Uncle Bud and Lydia made their home in her parent's
former inn which straddled the Alabama and Tennessee
line. It was built facing the west, and had ten rooms
with three upstairs rooms. The large north room, along
with the kitchen and dining rooms, were in Tennessee,
and the other rooms were in Alabama. Because of this
unusual feature it became a papular place for marriages.
My own Grandfather and Grandmother McDonald were married
there. My Grandpa liked to tell that he stood in
Tennessee and his bride in Alabama during the ceremony.
Fernanda Socrates McDonald died at this place on October
16, 1929, and is buried at St. Joseph, Tennessee. 1 was
not old enough to remember Uncle Bud, but he was talked
about so often in my family that it seems that I knew him.
In fact, just about everybody who grew up around Green Hill either knew Uncle Bud or knew about him. He was
well liked and highly respected. He worked with his
father, Elias, in the blacksmith and buggy shop, and when
Elias died in 1897, Uncle Bud took over the shop and
operated the business for almost all the remaining years
of his life. Following Uncle Bud's death in 1929, his
father's gun—manufacturing equipment, along with many
other personal items, sold at a public auction held in
front of the house. This sale included the family
pump organ that went for s 5.00 to Silas Taylor.
Fernanda McDonald was also an excellent wood craftsman,
and like many of the McDonalds I have know, could do
almost anything with wood. My Great-Uncle Jones Emory
McDonald owned a beautiful walking stick that Uncle Bud had
carved for him. Uncle Bud had a "green thumb," according
to the late historian, William Q. Hill. He built a
glass hot house for his plants and had "a good garden
even when neighbors experienced a bad crop year." His
granddaughter, Cleo Wilson, remembers her grandfather
McDonald having many walnut trees and every fall he would
box and ship his walnuts using the L&N Railroad at
nearby St. Joseph, Tennessee.
The children of Fernanda and Lydia McDonald were:

- Nora Lee (born August 6, 1880, and died May 28, 1956).
She was the wife of Daniel Lafayette Adkisson of
St. Joseph, Tennessee. There were no children.
- Meddie May (born May 8, 1882, and died November 18,
1907, and buried in the Holland Cemetery.)
Her obituary states that she was an active member of
the Green Hill Order of the Easter Star and held the
office of Associate Conductress at the time of her
death. She was also a dedicated and faithful
member of the Methodist Church at Green Hill.
- William Adron "Willie" McDonald (born December 23,
1883 and died March 5, 1892 and buried in the
Hoi land Cemetery.)
- Marshall Patrick McDonald was born April 30, 1885,
and died March 4, 1976, in a nursing home at
Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, at the age of 91 years.
He was married September 5, 1909, to Katie Belle
Richardson (.born July 28, 1890, and died November 1,
1930.) Katie's parents were George T. and Mollie
Killen Richardson. Marshall and Katie Are buried at
Richardson's Chapel Cemetery. They had seven
chiIdren:
o Essie Alberta McDonald, born December 13, 1910,
and is now deceased. She was married January 22,
1928, at St. Joseph, Tennessee, to William Ira
Johnson (born January 28, 1902, and died August 6, 1988, at Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. They had
two children:
— Ira Frances Johnson (born December 12,
1931, and died on the same day.)
— William Ira Johnson Junior (born August
16, 1933, and died May 11, 1935.)
o Marvin Louis McDonald was born August 24, 1912.

a carpenter and blacksmith, was a son of Henry James Burks
who was captured February 16, 1862, at Fort Donelson, and
died May 19, 1862, while in a Yankee prison at Camp Douglas,
Illinois. Ann Josephine met her future husband, James Henry
Burks, while he was working on the farm of her neighbor and
kinsman, Berry McDonald. They were the parents of five
chiIdren:

- R. Clarence Burks born October 9, 1974. He was
never married.
- M. Lacy Burks born June 18, 1876, and died of
typhoid fever about 1890 and is buried in the

child. I have a photograph of Buford made about
1889, sitting beside his mother's sister, Mattie
McDonald.
Following Ann Josephine's death, James Henry Burks
was married again on December 16, 1889, to Martha
Caldonia Richardson (born October 27, 1868, and died
February 27, 1963, and buried in the Stutts-Jenkins
Cemetery.) There were seven Burks children by this
second marriage: Joe Wheeler Burks (1890-1969); Bertha
Burks (born 1892, and was married to R. L. Mclnnish);
Elmer Burks (1894-1896); Macy Burks (born 1899, was
married to A. D. Mclnnish); Omega Burks (born 1904, was
married to M. L. Hall); Luther Lafayette Burks (1907-
1947, was married to Mary Lurene McKee); Meddia Burks
(1909-1909.) (Note: Luther Lafayette Burks, listed
above, has a son, Charles D. Burks, whose address is:
3501 New Haven Road, 300 Woodstock, Columbia, Missouri

65201. Macy Burks Mclnnish, listed above, makes her

Martha F. H. McDonald was the fifth child. She was born
December 19, 1853, and died July 14, 1855, and is buried
in the Holland Cemetery.
Mattie McDonald was the sixth and youngest child of Elias
M. McDonald and his wife Elmira Ross. Mattie was born
January 3, 1857, and died March 5, 1933. She is buried
in the Old Tabernacle Methodist Cemetery at Greenhill,
Alabama. Cousin Mattie was not married and after the
death of her parents lived upstairs in the home of her brother Fernanda McDonald. Following her brother's death
in 1929, Cousin Mattie moved into the home of her nephew,
Marshall McDonald. And here begins one of my favorite
family stories. You see, Mattie was an animal activist
long before the world knew about environmentalists and
those dedicated to the preservation of wild life. She
loved animals and, especially birds. One day, according
to the story, several of Cousin Mattie's great—nephews
came home with a wild duck they had killed. Mattie was
outraged that anybody would harm a beautiful and harm-
less duck. She became so incensed with Marshall's boys
that she packed her belongings and moved into the home
of a neighbor where she remained until her death in 1933,
although her nephew, Marshall, never ceased trying to
get her to return home.
This story about Cousin Mattie and the wild duck adds
yet another dimension to the ways of our McDonalds.
One has to have known the earlier members of our family
to appreciate Mattie's temper, resolve, and independence.
These attnbuters, according to those who have studied
the ways of the old Scots and ancient Celts, carried
over into the generations that came to America, and
more especially to that part of America known as the
South.


### THOMAS ANDERSON McDONALD

1822 - c. 1885
Thomas Anderson McDonald was the fourth child of John and Margaret
Emory McDonald. Anderson was born at Wartrace, Bedford County,
Tennessee, about 1822. He lived various times at Rawhide (now
Cloverdale) and on Cypress Creek near the old Parsonage Chapel
Methodist Church in Lauderdale County, Alabama. Early in his
marriage he was in both Wayne County and Lawrence County,
Tennessee. It was at Wayland Springs in Lawrence County where
he found Sarah A. Adkinson. Their marriage was recorded in
Lawrence County, Tennessee, on June 24, 1852. The Adkinsons were
early settlers of Wayland Springs, where Sarah was reared on her
father's plantation. Perhaps their marriage either followed
the move (or return) of Anderson's parents from Lauderdale
County to Wayland Springs, or influenced their relocation following
the wedding. The Lauderdale County Courthouse records show John
McDonald selling his 240—acre farm near Green Hill to Duncan
Steward in December, 1854. (John and Margaret McDonald were in
the 1850 Lauderdale County Census, and in 1860 were in the
Lawrence County, Tennessee, Census, although, in both census
reports they were listed as "McDaniel." My theory is that John
and Margaret McDonald were residing at Wayland Springs prior to
their move to Lauderdale County in 1834, and returned to Wayland
Springs at sometime during the early 1850s.
Following their marriage, Anderson and Sarah lived a number of
years at Wayland Springs, as their fourth child, Palina, was born
there in the Spring of 1859. Later, they were in Wayne County,
Tennessee, where they a r e listed in the 1860 Census. All of their
children listed their place of birth as "Tennessee," either in
Lawrence or Wayne County. In 1870, they were neighbors to my
Great-Grandparents, John Scruggs McDonald and Mary Frances
McDonald, on Cypress Creek near Parsonage Chapel between
Cloverdale Road and Chisholm Highway northwest of Florence.
Anderson was listed as a blacksmith, and my Great—Grandfather as
a miller. Anderson's fifth child, John McDonald, was a part of
my early childhood. He came every Summer and would stay several
weeks with us. At other times during the year, all of us would
load up in the family car and visit with him at his farm at Farmington,
Mississippi, about five or six miles from Corinth. We called him
"Uncle John." He told me many things about our family. He said
that the reason our two families were so close was that they were
reared together on Cypress Creek. He remembered the day my
Grandfather was born. His father, according to John, took tzare
of the horses and my Great—Grandfather ground the corn and corded
the wool for the community. John said that his family moved from
Cypress Creek to Cloverdale, called Rawhide, and were residing
there in 1881 at the time Frank and Jesse James robbed the payroll
at old Lock Six on the Muscle Shoals Canal, which becomes the
subject of yet another of John's tales that I will talk about later.
Anderson and Sarah McDonald had ten children:

1. Corinthus A. McDonald was born in 1855. The 1870 Wayne
County, Tennessee, census shows her as "Corintheus."
According to my notes made many years ago, Corinthus
was called "Berrys." However, I'm not now sure of
this information.
2. Martha Finch "Mattie" McDonald was born in 1856. She
died about 1933 or 1934 and was buried at the Canaan
United Methodist Church Cemetery in West Lauderdale
County. Mattie was married to David Phillips and
there were nine children:

- Luther Phillips
- Bobby Phillips
- Johnson Phillips
- Emmett Phillips
- James Phillips who had four children:
o Fannie Phillips who was married to a Goodman,
o Omie Phillips who was married to a Neal.
o Mary Phillips who was married to Charles
Skipworth. Mary and Charlie a r e leaders in
the Canaan United Methodist Church near
Smithsonia, where I served as their pastor
in the late 1940s. Jim was living then, and
they lived in the house with him. Following
Jim's death, Charlie and Mary inherited
the place and continue to reside there (at
2421 Cheatham Ferry Road, now County Road
65.) Mary and Charlie had one son:
— Charles T. Skipworth who owes a sheet
metal business at Florence. Charles is
married to Katherine Vafeas and they
have four children:
o Tommy Skipworth
o Phillip Skipworth who is married to
Sonya Bartlett and they have two
chiIdren:
— Ben Skipworth
— Sarah Katherine Skipworth
o Stephen Skipworth
o Pam Skipworth who is married to
Steve Herring and they have a child:
— Stephen Herring
o Myrtle Phillips who was married to a Ezekiel.
- Hester Phillips
- Dora Phillips
- Josephine Phillips who was married to a Barrett,
and had at least one daughter:
o Annie Barrett who was married to Ervin
Skipworth, a half-brother to Charlie. Their
farm was near the Rhodesville Community, and
when I knew them they were members of the
Rhodesville United Methodist Church.
Following Ervin's death, Annie was remarried
and now resides at Oakland. Annie knew much
about her McDonald ancestors and shared many
of her Grandmother Phillips' stories with me.
One was about one of our McDonald grandfathers
who, according to her Grandmother Phillips, lived to be over 100 years of age. This tale agreed
with similar legends that I have heard from
other family members. Yet, I have not been
able to find this ancestor, but I am still
looking. Ervin and Annie had a number of
daughters. I cannot remember their names,
but I do remember their son:
- Payton Skipworth. Payton was seriously
burned about 1957 when he was a boy.
I was in ECM hospital at the time for
surgery and shared a room with Payton.
His dear mother, Annie, would ride
the work bus into Florence every day
to take c.Are of Payton. In all of
my experience, I have never met a
more dedicated mother than Annie.
- Nannie Mary Ethel Phillips who was married to
Arnold Ransom "Dick" Irons. They had at least
one daughter:
o Leona Louise Irons was born September 15, 1913,
near Smithsonia in Lauderdale County, and
was married May 3, 1931, to Henry Jackson Neal
who was born March 28, 1910, in DeCabb County,
Tennessee. Henry died in a tragic car accident
on April 11, 1988. There a r e seven children:
— Henry Bobby Neal, born September 4, 1934,
and is married to Bertie McClusky.
— Helen Marie Neal, born September 1, 1936,
and is married to Willie E. Bird.

and is married to Debra Grigsby. Debbie

Authority Credit Union and a special friend.
Jackie and Debra have two children:
o Jennifer Nichole Neal, born February
15, 1978.
o Marshall Jackson Neal, born October
3, 1980.
— Dennis Vernon Neal, born October 25, 1954,
and is married to Martha Lee Balentine.

3. Commodore Harry McDonald, born in 1857 and died in 1917.
I think John McDonald called him "Horry," but am not now
sure. The late William Q. Hill thought that he was married
to a Hill. However, this is questionable in that Harry was
afflicted in some way and was never able to live alone.
Following the death of his parents. Commodore Harry lived
in Savannah, Tennessee, with his brother Frank. This is
where Harry was when he died, and he is buried there.
2. Palina Altimira "Kitty" McDonald was born March 31, 1859,
at Wayland Springs, Tennessee. Her middle name
"Altimira" was for her Aunt Artimena McDonald (who was
married to John English.) Kitty died August 5, 1936,
and is buried at Wesley Chapel United Methodist Church
near Cloverdale, Alabama. On November 29, 1876, Kittie
was married to William Eldredge "Bill" England who was
born March 1, 1853, and died March 6, 1905. I have
a copy of an early photograph made at the Bill England
farm near Rhodesville Community in 1908 or 1909 after
Bill's death. The house was a story—and—a—half structure
with a porch across the front and a picket fence around
the place. There were eight children in this family:

- Ella England was born September 17, 1877, and died
October 30, 1910. She was married to Rob Reed.

John McDonald, born in 1861, at Wayne County, Tennessee,
was the fifth child of Thomas Anderson McDonald. John
at one time owned several large farms at Farmington,
Mississippi, near Corinth. He was living on one of the
farms with his son, Sinclair, at the time of his death
in 1942 during World War II. We knew him as "Uncle
John." He and my Grandfather were first cousins, but
were more like brothers. They visited each other as long
as John lived. Even after John's death, it fell my lot
to drive my Grandfather periodically to Farmington to
visit with Sinclair. And when my Grandfather died in
1957, it was a comfort to see Cousin Sinclair at the
funeral. It would be difficult for me to write about
John — whom we called "Uncle John"
— and not mention
his hired man. Will. In England, old Will would have
been called a valet, or in the old South a body servant.
I marveled at how this old white servant took such good care
of his master. Before daylight on cold mornings, one
could hear Will as he went about the place lighting
fires at the hearths. He milked the cows, fed the pigs,
put on Uncle John's shoes and helped him dress, washed
the dishes, and on Mondays helped Cousin Beulah with
the washings. Will talked to himself. This amused my
brother Joe who liked to play pranks. One time Joe and
J. W., Sinclair's boy, climbed an apple tree to drop
apples on Will when he would walk by. Old Will turned around and had a whole lot to say to that tree
for raining apples on him. Will was quite intelligent.
One of the things we enjoyed was hearing him name
all the President's of the United States. After
Uncle John died, Sinclair took c a r e of Will as long as
he lived. We always looked forward to Uncle John's visits
every summer, as he would come and stay for weeks at a
time. He was the largest McDonald I have ever known.
John must have weighed 300 pounds or more, and was
probably, as I remember, about 5'9" in height. He
wore a ten-gallon Stetson hat, carried a nice walking cane,
and drove a pretty buggy and mare. When he sat at Mother's
table he required two chairs. I remember him as a fine
gentleman, with extremely nice manners. He held a high
value for education and the finer things of life. John was
one of the few family members who talked to me during
my early years about the necessity of getting a college
education. He asked once what I planned to do with my
life. I answered that I supposed I would like to be a
painter. I'll never forget his lecture. He said that I
should never stop at menial labor, but that I should apply
myself to the very best education that could be acquired.
College, he said, should be my aim and my dream to prepare
for tomorrow. I don't suppose he ever realized what his
lecture meant to that little boy. I would sit for hours
at his feet as he told interesting stories about the Civil
War and the events around his home at Rawhide (Cloverdale.)
When Jesse and Frank James robbed the old Muscle Shoals
Canal at Lock Six, they came by his father's farm near
Cloverdale. John watered and fed their horses, and when
he returned the horses to his father's sawmill, Jesse
James flipped him a gold coin as they rode away. Up until
then they had no idea that their visitors were the infamous
James Gang. However, as the outlaws were leaving, one of
them, perhaps Wild Bill Ryan, called to John: "Boy, when
you a r e grown you can tell folks that Jesse James gave you
that gold." John carried that coin in his pocket as long
as he lived. He always had it with him when he came to
visit, and one of my first requests was to see his Jesse
James coin. John lost all of his savings in the crash
of 1929. He did not trust banks and advised my Daddy
not to have anything to do with them. John was married
three times. He had one son by his first marriage:
o William Sinclair McDonald was born in 1900.
Following his father's death, Sinclair sold the
old homeplace and moved to another nearby farm
that he had inherited from John. This place had
some rather steep grades and a number of washed-
out gullies, as I remember. On May 21, 1961, he
was plowing on one of these places when his tractor
turned over pinning him underneath and causing
his untimely death at the age of 61 years. Uncle
Alphonse and I attended his funeral at Farmmgton
Baptist Church. He was buried behind this Church.
Sinclair was married to his step-sister Beulah,
who was a daughter of John's third wife. Beulah was
a gracious and good lady who always opened her
home to those of us who loved to visit our Uncle
John. Sinclair and Beulah had two children:
- J. W. McDonald was born about 1930. He
now resides at Route 3, Box 219, Corinth,
Mississippi 38834.
— Peggy McDonald who was born sometime during
World War II. She received her degree from
Florence State University a number of years
following her father's death. We arranged
for her to live with my mother—in-law,
Mrs. Lacy Carter, while she was in college.
After receiving her degree Peggy taught
school around Corinth. She is married to
Harold Isbeil. Harold had a large farm that
he subdivided so as to build and sell houses.
Peggy and Harold reside at the center of this
subdivision located in the a r e a of the
hospital west of Corinth. Their home is
something to behold. It has the appearance
of a large Louisiana plantation manor house
overlooking the entire village below. The
address is: 1303 Pine Lake Drive. Their
mailing address is: Route 7, Box 18,
Corinth, Mississippi 35834.

6. Joseph "Joe" McDonald, born in 1863, was the sixth child of
Thomas Anderson McDonald.
2. William Scruggs McDonald (born in 1866) was married
twice. There were three children by first marriage.
, Scruggs' second marriage was to Mattie Lucendy Curtis,
and there were four children by this marriage:
o Edgar McDonald
o Albert McDonald
o Floyd McDonald
o Lee McDonald was married to Ethel England Scott.
There was at least one child:
— Robert Lee "Bud" McDonald whose wife. Ruby,
died March 28, 1994, at the age of 68 years.
Ruby was a retired nurse at Eliza Coffee
Memorial Hospital. She was buried in the
Mount Zion Church of Christ Cemetery on Butler
Creek Road near Florence. They had one son:
o Jerry L. McDonald who has three
children and two grandchildren,
o Charles McDonald was married to a lady named
Etta. During my early years "Nub," as we called
him, and Etta lived in the old Simpson Plantation
House. This ancient brick structure held a
great fascination for me. I wish I had a
photograph of it. It was built in the same style
as the Koger Plantation Manor House near Smithsonia. The old Simpson Place and its nearby
cemetery were bulldozed and destroyed a few years
after the new Florence Boulevard was routed into
Florence. Charlie and Etta had a number of
daughters and one or more sons.
o Frank McDonald was married to a lady by the name
of Bessie. I seem to remember that Frank lived
near the old Watkins place on Butler Creek Road
when I was a boy. They had a son:

- Billy McDonald
o Mary McDonald

8. Thomas Franklin McDonald, known as "Frank", was born
December 22, 1869, in Wayne County, Tennessee, and died
August 5, 1953, at Savannah, Tennessee. Frank was first
married to Sibiana Eaton. Following her death, he was
married September 27, 1903, to Ella Rebecca Tackett who
was born in March, 1887, and died in January, 1980. Ella's
sister had a daughter, Jean, who was married to Alvin
"Rusty" Parker of Florence. Jean, who is now deceased,
was a popular math professor at the University of North
Alabama. Frank McDonald had two children by his first
marriage and three by the second marriage:
o Nellie McDonald died when she was about three years
of age.
o Anna Belle McDonald died at Savannah, Tennessee,
in 1984. She was married to Jim McLean and there
were three children:
— Edith McLean who was married to Mack Hogan
and resides at 4978 Ridge Park Drive, Memphis,
Tennessee.
— Mary McLean
— Jack McLean
o John Anderson McDonald was born March 5, 1909.
I remember listening to John on the WSM Radio
Station at Nashville. He was a large man, had a
deep, pleasing voice, and was nationally known
for his daily farm report. This, more than anything
else, was due to his homespun and earthy style
of delivering farm news and conducting interviews
on agribusiness. He traveled extensively to
gather the farm news from across the country. John
attended the University of Tennessee at Martin and
later at Knoxvilie. He was married to Evelyn Morton
and their was no issue. John died of cancer November
26, 1983, at Park View Hospital in Nashville.
o Helen McDonald was born June 18, 1914, and was
married to Barney Clement. She resides at Decatur,
Alabama.
o Frankie McDonald was born September 18, 1921, and
is married to a Webb. She resides at Houston, Texas.
2. Sarah McDonald, a twin with Thomas Franklin, was born
December 22, 1869, in Wayne County, Tennessee. She died
not long after her birth.
3. Fannie McDonald was born in 1873 near Parsonage Chapel
in Lauderdale County, Alabama. Fannie is not listed
by other family genealogists. However, I remember
John mentioning his sister Fannie and, therefore, I am
showing her as the youngest child of Thomas Anderson
McDonald.
