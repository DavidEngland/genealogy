# Valentine Ball - Source Citations

## Research Summary

**Important Note:** Extensive research by Rachel M. Lennon published in leading genealogical journals indicates there is **NO evidence** to tie Valentine Ball to the Ball family of George Washington's mother. "Nor does evidence support a family tradition of kinship to the illustrious Balls from whom George Washington's mother descends, a family rooted in the Corotoman River area of Lancaster County, before 1653, by the merchant and planter Col. William Ball."
