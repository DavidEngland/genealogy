== Biography ==

'''Captain William John Brown Parish''' (April 27, 1833 – December 5, 1883) was a prominent resident of **Lauderdale County, Alabama**, known for his resilience as a **Civil War prisoner of war** and his legendary role in the frontier justice of the Shoals area. He was the son of Mr. & Mrs. William Brown Parish.

=== Early Life and Ancestry ===

Brown Parish married '''[[Parish-371 | Rachael Emily Haddock]]''' (1838–1908), daughter of **War of 1812 veteran James Haddock Jr.**<ref>Conversation History; Family records</ref> Their union further connected the **Parish** and **Haddock** lines, which were cornerstone families of the **Wayne County, Tennessee**, and **Lauderdale County, Alabama**, borderlands.

Rachael is remembered for her own significant community contribution; she '''donated the land''' on which the **New Hope Church of Christ** was established—a congregation that would serve the community for generations.<ref>Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresham'', 1976-1977, pp. 28, 48.</ref>

=== Civil War Service and POW Survival ===

**Enlistment and Service:** Captain Parish enlisted in '''Nixon's 22nd Tennessee Cavalry Regiment''' at **West Point, Tennessee**. He served under '''Colonel George H. Nixon''' in North Alabama and Middle Tennessee during the final years of the conflict (1864–1865).<ref>22nd (Nixon's) Tennessee Cavalry Regiment records</ref>

**Capture at Franklin:** Parish was captured during the '''Battle of Franklin''' on **November 30, 1864**, one of the war's most brutal engagements, fought near Franklin, Tennessee during General Hood's invasion of Tennessee.<ref>Battle of Franklin records; Official Records of the War of the Rebellion. National Archives.</ref> The battle claimed over 30,000 casualties, making it one of the bloodiest single-day engagements of the entire war.

**Camp Douglas Internment:** Parish survived internment at '''Camp Douglas''' near Chicago, a Union prisoner-of-war camp notorious for its high mortality rate due to disease, exposure, and poor conditions. Approximately 30,000 Confederate prisoners were held at Camp Douglas during the war, with roughly 6,000 dying from these causes.<ref>Camp Douglas (Chicago) Prisoner-of-War Camp Records. National Archives.</ref> His survival of this ordeal earned him respect as a man of unusual fortitude.

**Parole:** Upon his release, Parish received a '''$10 gold piece''' and was required to take an '''oath not to bear arms against the Union'''—a common practice by Federal forces to encourage Confederate soldiers to cease active resistance.<ref>Parole records; Family oral history</ref> He honored this oath, like many paroled Confederate soldiers, and did not return to active combat.

=== Postwar Years and Community Standing ===

After the war, Captain Parish returned to Lauderdale County, Alabama, where he resumed his role as a prominent community member. The sources identify him as a man of standing, and his numerous children and grandchildren would become influential figures throughout the Shoals region.

=== The "Bugger's Saga" and Mountain Tom Clark ===

According to family oral history and the legendary **"Bugger's Saga,"** Parish was the victim of a harrowing attack by the notorious outlaw '''Mountain Tom Clark''' after the war.

**The Robbery:** Believing Parish had hidden gold, Clark's gang committed a brutal assault. They '''hung him upside down naked''' in his home and '''beat him nearly to death''', leaving him for dead.<ref>Bugger's Saga family account</ref>

**The Rescue:** The women of the household had been successfully hidden during the raid; they eventually emerged to '''cut him down and nurse him back to health'''.<ref>Bugger's Saga family account</ref>

**The Hanging and Justice:** Parish later saw justice served. When Tom Clark was finally captured and sentenced to hang in '''Florence, Alabama''', Parish was present at the execution and reportedly '''placed his hand on the rope''' that executed the outlaw. The execution reportedly made the '''New York Times'''.<ref>Bugger's Saga family account; New York Times records (1865–1870s era)</ref> Tom Clark remains '''buried under Tennessee Street''' in Florence, Alabama.

=== Family and Legacy ===

Parish was the patriarch of an exceptionally large family. The sources specifically name children such as '''[[Parish-371 | William Archabald Parish, Esq.]]''' (locally known as "Squire" Parish, who served as a Justice of the Peace) and '''[[Parish-378 | Laroca Francis Parish]]''', but family records indicate he had approximately '''20 children''', many of whom married into prominent Lauderdale County families and continued the Parish tradition of community leadership.<ref>Conversation History; Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresham'', 1976-1977.</ref>

His son '''William Archabald Parish''' inherited his father's community standing and would become a respected Justice of the Peace himself, presiding over local marriages and legal matters in the Oakland area.

=== Death and Burial ===

William Brown Parish passed away on '''December 5, 1883''', at an advanced age. He was laid to rest at the '''Pleasant Hill United Methodist Church Cemetery''' in Lauderdale County, Alabama. He is remembered as a man of the "Considerable covenant," whose life embodied the '''independence and resolve''' of the **Scots-Celtic pioneers** of the Shoals.

=== Military Service Summary ===

==== 22nd (NIXON'S) TENNESSEE CAVALRY REGIMENT ====

Also called 20th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment

Organized in spring of 1864; consolidated about March, 1865 with 14th (Neely's), 15th (Stewart's) and 21st (N. W. Carter's) to form Nixon's Consolidated Regiment; paroled at Gainesville, Alabama, May, 1865.

Colonel George H. Nixon had formerly been colonel of the 48th (Nixon's) Tennessee Infantry Regiment. After the Battle of Chickamauga, September, 1863, this regiment was placed in a field consolidation with the 35th (Hill's) Tennessee Infantry, and Colonel Nixon, Lieutenant Colonel Hughs, and other officers of the 48th, placed on the supernumerary list. They were directed by the Secretary of War to raise within the enemy lines in Tennessee a command of cavalry. The command so raised never received official designation by the Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, but was known in the field as the 20th, the 22nd, or as Nixon's Regiment. No muster rolls, regimental returns, nor rosters of the regiment were found, but the regiment was first mentioned in the Official Records in March, 1864. Parole records, prisoner of war records, etc. show that Colonel George H. Nixon was the colonel; T. R. Hughs, formerly of the
48th Infantry, lieutenant colonel; and Captain Calvin Gilbert in command of the regiment March 15, 1865.

Colonel Nixon, in a sketch in ''Lindsley's Annals'', stated that he established headquarters at Lamb's Ferry on the Tennessee River, where he was joined by Captain Thomas H. Paine, with a company which he had organized
and brought out of Middle Tennessee, mainly from Lawrence County. This company formed the nucleus of the regiment, and camp was established on the south side of the river, near Muscle Shoals.

Colonel Nixon listed Thomas H. Paine, Lewis Miller, O. T.
Plummer, James R. Voss, George P. H. Craig, and John W. Benham as being captains in his regiment, and miscellaneous records showed a James Stewart as commanding a company, also a Captain F. P. Scot, but no other record of the companies composing the regiment was found. Paine and Miller were from Lawrence County. Individual records showed men from Lawrence, Wayne, Giles, Marshall and Maury Counties, Tennessee, and some from Mississippi.

On March 26, 1864, Senator R. W. Walker, of Alabama, writing
to General Gideon I. Pillow about the situation in North Alabama, wrote:
&quot;Colonel Nixon, of Lawrenceburg, said to be a good officer, has a new
battalion, numbering about 150 or 200 men, somewhere in the valley.&quot;Lieutenant Colonel T. R. Hughs was captured May 28, 1864 in a skirmish with Federal troops near Moulton, Alabama, and remained a prisoner until the end of the war. On July 12, 1864, a Federal report of a scout in Morgan (Alabama) and Lawrence (Tennessee) Counties, reported Nixon's Regiment, about 250 or 300 strong, at Pond Spring, Alabama. Two weeks later, on July 26, a Federal report of a skirmish on Big Name Creek, near Courtland, Alabama, named Nixon's Regiment as part of the Confederate forces engaged, and said a Colonel Carter was also expected to join them with 200 men. This was Colonel Nathan W. Carter, with a
new regiment, the 21st Tennessee Cavalry (q.v.), in process of organization.

On September 20, General Joseph Wheeler, at Tuscumbia, Alabama, ordered: &quot;The following troops of this corps will immediately
report to Major General Forrest and accompany him on his expedition into Middle Tennessee: Colonel McLemore, with the 4th Tennessee, Colonel Nixon, with Nixon's Regiment, and Colonel Biffie, commanding a Brigade of Tennessee Troops.&quot; In obedience to this order, the regiment joined General Forrest in time to take part in the capture of Athens, Alabama on September 24. In Forrest's report of this action, he wrote: &quot;I ordered Colonel Carter and Colonel Nixon with their respective commands, (about 150 men each) to move rapidly to the relief of Colonel Wilson. They did so, and after a short engagement the re-enforcements surrendered and marched up just in time to see the garrison march out of the fort and stack their arms. ****The prisoners and captured property were immediately started for Cherokee under the command of Colonel Nixon.&quot;

During November and December, 1864, Nixon's regiment was in Colonel (later Brigadier General) T. H. Bell's Brigade, of Forrest's command, in the invasion of Tennessee by. General Hood, ending with the Battles of Franklin and of Nashville. After the termination of this campaign, Forrest's forces withdrew into Mississippi, where on February 13, 1865, General Forrest ordered all the Tennessee troops in his command to report to Brigadier General W. H. Jackson at Verona, Mississippi, for consolidation into six regiments. Nixon's Regiment was one of those specifically named in the order. A regimental roster dated March 15, 1865, at West Point, Mississippi, Captain Gilbert commanding, gave a list of deserters on the march from Verona, Mississippi to West Point.

Soon after this, Nixon's Regiment was consolidated with the 14th (Neely's), 15th (Stewart's-Logwood's) and 21st (N. W. Carter's) Regiments to form Nixon's Consolidated Regiment. Captain Zillman Voss, of the 14th, and Captain Newt I. Vaughn, of Nathan W. Carter's Regiment commanded companies in the consolidated regiment.

'''FIELD OFFICERS of the consolidated regiment were:'''

* ''Colonel''-George H. Nixon
* ''Lieutenant Colonel''-Thomas H. Logwood
* ''Major''-James M. Crews

The regiment was placed in Brigadier General A. W. Campbell's
Brigade.

Colonel Nixon stated the regiment had an engagement with two
regiments of Federal cavalry, and drove them across the Cahaba River, near
Centreville, Alabama, shortly before the surrender and parole of the regiment at Gainesville, Alabama in May, 1865. Colonel Nixon himself was in command of Colonel E. W. Rucker's Brigade until shortly before the surrender, Colonel Rucker having been wounded and captured at Nashville on December 16, 1864.
