== Biography ==

'''Captain William John Brown Parish''' (April 27, 1833 – December 5, 1883) was a prominent resident of **Lauderdale County, Alabama**, known for his resilience as a **Civil War prisoner of war** and his legendary role in frontier justice in the Shoals area. He was the son of William Brown Parish and his wife.

=== Early Life and Family ===

Brown Parish married '''[[Parish-371 | Rachael Emily Haddock]]''' (1838–1908), daughter of **War of 1812 veteran James Haddock Jr.** Their union connected the **Parish** and **Haddock** families, cornerstone settlers of **Wayne County, Tennessee**, and **Lauderdale County, Alabama**.<ref>Conversation History; Family records</ref>

Rachael made significant community contributions, notably donating the land on which **New Hope Church of Christ** was established.<ref>Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresham''. Hutchinson, Kansas, 1976-1977, pp. 28, 48.</ref>

=== Civil War Service and POW Survival ===

**Enlistment and Service:** Parish enlisted in '''Nixon's 22nd Tennessee Cavalry Regiment''' at **West Point, Tennessee** (Lawrence County), serving under '''Colonel George H. Nixon''' in North Alabama and Middle Tennessee (1864–1865).<ref>22nd (Nixon's) Tennessee Cavalry Regiment records</ref> 

This region was a Confederate recruiting hub where local leader **Thomas H. Paine** raised cavalry in 1862, and irregular home-guard activity targeted Unionists in surrounding districts.<ref>Lawrence County Civil War recruitment histories, incl. lawcohistory.com (2015), TCWPA battle site notes, and ADA299772 guerrilla overview.</ref> Family oral history also recalls the Confederate guerrilla outfit **"Voorhies"** encamping across the river from Florence near Bainbridge (later inundated by **TVA's Wilson Dam**).<ref>Family oral history (Bainbridge/Voorhies camp, Wilson Dam)</ref>

**Nature of Service:** Nixon's regiment was organized in spring 1864 as a **light cavalry** command raised behind enemy lines, functioning as **mobile guerrilla raiders** in Union-occupied Middle Tennessee and North Alabama. These irregular forces served as the **"eyes and ears"** for larger Confederate maneuvers under '''General Nathan Bedford Forrest''', conducting independent strikes against Federal supply lines. Parish's unit exemplified frontier warfare tactics of the Western Theater's final phase—swift raids, ambushes, and evasion.<ref>Military Service Summary; Official Records of the War of the Rebellion.</ref>

**Capture at Franklin:** This hit-and-run warfare changed drastically on '''November 30, 1864''', when Parish's regiment was swept into '''General John Bell Hood's''' massive frontal assault at the '''Battle of Franklin'''—one of the war's most brutal engagements. The battle was characterized by hand-to-hand combat and catastrophic losses of Confederate leadership. During this chaotic action, '''Captain Parish was captured''' by Union forces.<ref>Battle of Franklin records; Official Records of the War of the Rebellion. National Archives.</ref> The battle claimed over 30,000 casualties.

**Camp Douglas Internment:** Parish was transported to '''Camp Douglas''' near Chicago, a Union POW camp notorious for high mortality rates due to disease, exposure, and poor conditions. Approximately 6,000 of 30,000 Confederate prisoners died there.<ref>Camp Douglas (Chicago) Prisoner-of-War Camp Records. National Archives.</ref> His survival earned him respect for unusual fortitude.

**Parole:** Upon release, Parish received a **$10 gold piece** and oath not to bear arms against the Union—common Federal practice to encourage Confederate soldiers to cease resistance.<ref>Parole records; Family oral history</ref> He honored this oath and did not return to active combat.

=== Postwar Years and Community Standing ===

After the war, Parish returned to Lauderdale County and resumed his role as a prominent community member.

**Reconstruction and the Search for Gold:** During Reconstruction, the largest cavalry ever assembled in the region camped on '''Texas Ridge''' near Wright Community (east of Waterloo, west of Natchez Trace, along Tennessee River's north shore). Parish became a target of suspicion—Union soldiers believed he had hidden gold and searched his property, never finding the cache concealed in **old saddle bags on his front porch**.<ref>Gresham family oral history; Conversation History</ref> 

'''William Archabald Parish''' (later "Squire" Parish), who witnessed this event as a child, repeatedly recounted the story to his son and others throughout his lifetime, helping preserve this family memory.<ref>Family oral history; Squire W.A. Parish account</ref>

=== The "Bugger's Saga" and Mountain Tom Clark ===

According to family oral history, Parish was attacked by notorious outlaw '''Mountain Tom Clark''' after the war.

**The Robbery:** Believing Parish had hidden gold, Clark's gang hung him upside down naked in his home and beat him nearly to death.<ref>Bugger's Saga family account</ref>

**The Rescue:** The household women, who had been hidden during the raid, emerged to cut him down and nurse him back to health.<ref>Bugger's Saga family account</ref>

**Justice:** When Tom Clark was captured and sentenced to hang in '''Florence, Alabama''', Parish was present at the execution and reportedly placed his hand on the rope.<ref>Bugger's Saga family account; New York Times records (1865–1870s era)</ref> Clark is buried under Tennessee Street in Florence, Alabama.

**The Haddock Family's Role:** Parish's Haddock in-laws—his wife Rachael's kinsmen—played a crucial role in stopping Clark and his gang at '''Gravelly Springs''' before they could fence their stolen property at Texas Ridge.<ref>Bugger's Saga family account; Gresham family oral history</ref>

=== Family and Legacy ===

Parish was patriarch of an exceptionally large family. Family records specifically name '''[[Parish-371 | William Archabald Parish, Esq.]]''' (locally "Squire" Parish, Justice of the Peace) and '''[[Parish-378 | Laroca Francis Parish]]''', with approximately '''20 children''' total who married into prominent Lauderdale County families.<ref>Conversation History; Gresham, Virgil L. ''A Family Named Gresham'', 1976-1977.</ref>

His son **William Archabald Parish** became a respected Justice of the Peace, presiding over local marriages and legal matters in Oakland.

=== Death and Burial ===

William Brown Parish died on '''December 5, 1883''' at an advanced age. He was laid to rest at '''Pleasant Hill United Methodist Church Cemetery''' in Lauderdale County, Alabama, remembered as a man of "Considerable covenant" whose life embodied the '''independence and resolve''' of **Scots-Celtic pioneers** of the Shoals.
