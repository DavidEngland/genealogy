== Biography ==

'''Solomon Whitley''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-754]]) (abt. 1723 – abt. 1782) was an Irish immigrant who became the patriarch of a prominent pioneer family in early America. Born in '''Northern Ireland''' between 1720 and 1723, he was the son of '''[[Whitley-1755|John Whitley]]''' and '''[[Mitchell-16478|Ervie (Mitchell) Whitley]]'''. 

### Early Life and Virginia Settlement

Solomon married '''[[Barnett-2252|Elizabeth Barnett]]''' (abt. 1723 – abt. 1782) in Ireland before 1745. They immigrated to the American colonies and settled in '''Augusta County, Virginia''', in the portion that later became '''Rockbridge County'''.

Legal records in Augusta County place him there by 1753, when he was ordered to maintain the road from Joseph Long's mill to James Young’s plantation. In 1765, he appeared in processioning records alongside neighbors such as the Gilmores and McCameys. While living in Virginia, he and Elizabeth raised their nine children.

### Migration to Kentucky and Final Years

Around 1779, Solomon and Elizabeth followed their son, the noted pioneer '''[[Whitley-757|William Chapman Whitley]]''', to the Kentucky frontier. They settled at '''Whitley's Station''' (also called Walnut Flat or Walnut Creek) near '''Crab Orchard'''. Solomon was a devout man who reportedly taught the old Presbyterian catechism to his grandchildren at the station. He and Elizabeth both died about 1782 at Whitley's Station in Lincoln County, Kentucky.

### Family and Legacy

Solomon and Elizabeth had nine documented children:

1. '''[[Whitley-749|Margaret Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-749]]) (abt. 1747 – abt. 1831); married George Clark.
2. '''[[Whitley-752|Ruth (Whitley) Collier]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-752]]) (abt. 1748 – 1789); married Moses Collier.
3. '''[[Whitley-757|William Chapman Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-757]]) (1749 – 1813); famed Kentucky pioneer and Indian fighter.
4. '''[[Whitley-750|Mary Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-750]]) (abt. 1750).
5. '''[[Whitley-748|James Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-748]]) (abt. 1752); Baptist minister in Lincoln County.
6. '''[[Whitley-753|Sarah (Whitley) Lewis]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-753]]) (abt. 1752 – 1837); married '''[[Lewis-9841|Joseph Francis Lewis]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Lewis-9841]]).
7. '''[[Whitley-755|Solomon Whitley Jr.]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-755]]) (abt. 1758); married Polly Scott.
8. '''[[Whitley-747|Catherine Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-747]]) (abt. 1760); married John Parkinson.
9. '''[[Whitley-756|Thomas Whitley]]''' (WikiTree ID: [[Whitley-756]]) (abt. 1760).

### Research Notes

Sibling discrepancy: The '''Draper Manuscript''' records William Chapman Whitley stating he had three brothers and five sisters and that he was the oldest brother. This implies some individuals later listed as Solomon's children may actually have been his younger siblings.

Documented siblings attributed to Solomon include twins Jonathan and Paul Whitley, Moses Whitley, Ann Whitley, and Michael Whitley (abt. 1730 – 1777), who died in Philadelphia and married Martha.
