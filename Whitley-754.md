== Biography ==

'''Solomon Whitley''' (abt. 1723 – abt. 1782) was an Irish immigrant who became the patriarch of a prominent pioneer family in early America. Born in '''Northern Ireland''' between 1720 and 1723, he was the son of '''[[Whitley-1755|John Whitley]]''' and '''[[Mitchell-16478|Ervie (Mitchell) Whitley]]'''. Family tradition says he left Ireland due to religious persecution.

### Early Life and Virginia Settlement

Solomon married '''[[Barnett-2252|Elizabeth Barnett]]''' (abt. 1723 – abt. 1782) in Ireland before 1745. They immigrated to the American colonies and settled in '''Augusta County, Virginia''', in the portion that later became '''Rockbridge County'''.

Legal records in Augusta County place him there by 1753, when he was ordered to maintain the road from Joseph Long's mill to James Young’s plantation. In 1765, he appeared in processioning records alongside neighbors such as the Gilmores and McCameys. While living in Virginia, he and Elizabeth raised their nine children.

### Migration to Kentucky and Final Years

Around 1779, Solomon and Elizabeth followed their son, the noted pioneer '''[[Whitley-757|William Chapman Whitley]]''', to the Kentucky frontier. They settled at '''Whitley's Station''' (also called Walnut Flat or Walnut Creek) near '''Crab Orchard'''. Solomon was a devout man who reportedly taught the old Presbyterian catechism to his grandchildren at the station. He and Elizabeth both died about 1782 at Whitley's Station in Lincoln County, Kentucky.

### Family and Legacy

Solomon and Elizabeth had nine documented children:

1. '''[[Whitley-749|Margaret Whitley]]''' (abt. 1747 – abt. 1831); married George Clark.
2. '''[[Whitley-752|Ruth (Whitley) Collier]]''' (abt. 1748 – 1789); married Moses Collier. Her grandson was John Aaron Rawlins, Union General and Secretary of War under President Ulysses S. Grant.
3. '''[[Whitley-757|William Chapman Whitley]]''' (1749 – 1813); famed Kentucky pioneer and Indian fighter; built the first brick house west of the Blue Ridge Mountains; died at the Battle of the Thames.
4. '''[[Whitley-750|Mary Whitley]]''' (abt. 1750).
5. '''[[Whitley-748|James Whitley]]''' (abt. 1752); Baptist minister in Lincoln County.
6. '''[[Whitley-753|Sarah (Whitley) Lewis]]''' (abt. 1752 – 1837); married '''[[Lewis-9841|Joseph Francis Lewis]]''', the brickmason who built William Whitley's historic house.
7. '''[[Whitley-755|Solomon Whitley Jr.]]''' (abt. 1758); married Polly Scott.
8. '''[[Whitley-747|Catherine Whitley]]''' (abt. 1760); married John Parkinson.
9. '''[[Whitley-756|Thomas Whitley]]''' (abt. 1760).

### Research Notes

Sibling discrepancy: The '''Draper Manuscript''' records William Chapman Whitley stating he had three brothers and five sisters and that he was the oldest brother. This implies some individuals later listed as Solomon's children may actually have been his younger siblings.

Documented siblings attributed to Solomon include twins Jonathan and Paul Whitley, Moses Whitley, Ann Whitley, and Michael Whitley (abt. 1730 – 1777), who died in Philadelphia and married Martha.
