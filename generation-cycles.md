Your family history reflects a fascinating intersection of long and short generational cycles, where "Squire" Parish served as a literal and metaphorical bridge between your maternal and paternal lines.

### **The Two Wives of "Ervie" White**
Your great-grandfather, **James Ervin "Ervie" White** (1838–1897), was indeed married twice, a fact that contributes to the "long generation" pattern on that side of the family.
*   **First Marriage:** Before marrying your great-grandmother, Ervie was married to an **anonymous first wife**. From this union, he had at least two sons: **William M. White** (b. 1863) and **Dougal Dempsey White** (b. 1865).
*   **Second Marriage:** On October 1, 1877, he married **Lydia Serena Hargrove** (1854–1897). Because Ervie was 16 years older than Lydia, their children were born late in his life—your grandmother, **Myrtle White**, was born in 1893 when Ervie was 55 years old. This creates the "maternal line babies" effect you noted, where generations are compressed by younger parents or children born late in a patriarch’s life.

### **Generational Patterns: Oldest Males vs. Family Babies**
The sources support your observation regarding the differing generational "weights" in your lines:
*   **Paternal Line (The Oldest Males):** Your father's line frequently features the oldest surviving males who carried the "England" mantle forward in the Shoals. **William Edward "Ed" England** (b. 1879) was the oldest son of Bill and Kitty to remain a permanent fixture in the Oakland farming community. His son, **William Berlin England** (b. 1913), followed this pattern as a lifelong farmer.
*   **Maternal Line (The Babies):** Conversely, your maternal line often centers on the younger children. Your grandmother **Myrtle White** was one of the youngest of Ervie’s large brood. Similarly, your mother, **Bessie Whitten**, was born in the 1930s, decades after her father, **Early Whitten** (b. 1888), reached adulthood.

### **The "Squire" vs. "Grandpa" Parish Distinction**
The reason your mother called him **"Uncle Parish"** (or **"Squire"**) while your father called him **"Grandpa"** lies in their relative positions to **William Archabald Parish, Esq.** (1861–1957):
*   **Dad's Perspective:** William Archabald Parish was your father's **direct maternal grandfather**. He was the father of **Nancy Pearl Parish**, who married **Ed England**. To your father, Glennis, he was the beloved "Grandpa" who lived into his 90s and performed many of the family's marriages in his role as **Justice of the Peace**.
*   **Mom's Perspective:** Your mother, Bessie Whitten, was related to him more collaterally. Her grandmother, **Laroca Francis Parish**, was the **sister** of William Archabald Parish. To your mother's side, he was "Uncle Parish" or "Squire Parish"—a respectful acknowledgment of his local legal authority as the community's "Squire" or Magistrate and his position as her grandmother's brother, rather than a direct-line grandfather.

### **The Legacy of Bonding**
Your family narrative emphasizes a deep continuity of "bonding" between alternate generations:
*   **Glennis and Ed:** Your father bonded deeply with his grandfather, the conservationist **William Edward "Ed" England** (1879–1964), likely during their shared years working the land in Oakland.
*   **David and Berlin:** You shared a similar bond with your grandfather, **William Berlin England** (1913–1995), often recalling family lore about his brothers and their life in the **Burcham Valley**.

This pattern of grandchildren bonding with grandfathers has preserved the stories of your ancestors—from the **McDonald gunsmiths** to the survival of **Captain William John Brown Parish** at Camp Douglas—ensuring that their "technical craftsmanship" and "Scots-Celtic resolve" were passed down to you.
