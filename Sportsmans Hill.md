The **Filson Club History Quarterly (Vol. 25, April 1951)** provides a detailed historical account of the life of Kentucky pioneer **William Whitley** and the construction of his home, "**Sportsman's Hill**" [1, 2]. This structure was significant as the **first brick house** built west of the Blue Ridge Mountains [2, 3].

### **The Brickwork and Joseph Lewis**
According to legend recorded in the quarterly, the **brickwork** for the Whitley house was performed by **Joseph Lewis** [2]. Joseph was a skilled **brickmason** who had married William Whitley’s sister, **Sarah Whitley**, connecting the two men as brothers-in-law [4, 5]. His specialized skills were in high demand on the frontier, where most residents lived in log cabins [6, 7].

### **The "German" and the Supply of Spirits**
The quarterly also identifies a **German** man with the "rather un-German name" of **Henry Clark** [2]. Clark is legendary for having **furnished the whisky** for the workmen during the construction of the house [2]. Like the mason, he was reportedly **paid in land** for his contribution to the project [2].

### **The Land Deed and Payment**
The **Lincoln County Deed Books** provide physical evidence of the transaction between Whitley and Lewis [2]. On **October 21, 1805**, Whitley executed a **land deed** to **Joseph F. Lewis** for **228 acres** of his land in exchange for a consideration of **£328** [2].
*   **Cost Analysis:** The quarterly notes that if this land transfer constituted full payment for the masonry, the brickwork would have cost roughly **$1,500**, a "no mean sum for that day" [2].
*   **Missing Records:** While the deed to Lewis is well-documented, the sources mention there is **no record** of Whitley land being transferred to a **Henry Clark**; the closest matching record is an 1804 sale of 243 acres to a **Henry Sheven** [2].

**Analogy for Understanding:**
If the Whitley house was the **crown jewel of the Kentucky frontier**, then **Joseph Lewis** provided the **unbreakable setting** through his masonry, while **Henry Clark** provided the **"liquid fuel"** that kept the frontier craftsmen working until the job was done [2, 7].
