== Biography ==

'''Martha E. Duncan''' was born on '''25 July 1832''' in Lauderdale County, Alabama. She was the third child of '''Moses "Mose" Duncan''' (1807–1868) and '''Sarah Tapley "Sally" Clark''' (1806–1894), part of a prominent family of South Carolinian pioneers who settled the Lauderdale County region.

=== Early Life and Family ===

Martha's ancestry traces back to '''John Duncan "The Elder"''' (c. 1720–c. 1805), a Scottish immigrant from Aberdeen who originally settled Duncan's Creek in South Carolina. Growing up in the Green Hill community, Martha was part of a large household. Her documented siblings include '''[[Duncan-3604|George Washington Duncan]]''' (b. 1832), '''[[Duncan-3626|Thomas Jefferson Duncan]]''' (b. 1842), and '''[[Duncan-3625|James Andrew Duncan]]''' (b. 1845).

=== Marriage ===

Martha married '''[[Whitten-500|Jesse P. Whitten]]''' (1827–1882) on '''14 June 1850'''. This union solidified a long-standing alliance between the Duncan and Whitten families, who were both prominent in the Tennessee-Alabama borderlands. According to family records, legal documents indicate that William Thornton served as guardian for William R. Duncan, working alongside the Whitten family in the administration of the county's affairs.

=== Children ===

Martha and Jesse had 11 documented children, according to WikiTree genealogy records:
* '''[[Whitten-509|John W. Whitten]]'''

* '''[[Whitten-511|Henry Whitten]]'''
* '''[[Whitten-512|Wiley Whitten]]'''

Robert Duncan carried the Duncan name in tribute to his mother's Scottish heritage and Aberdeen ancestry. The family's children married into the prominent Gresham, Parish, and related families of the region.

=== Life and Legacy ===

Martha is remembered as a foundational matriarch, providing the middle name "Duncan" to her son Robert and subsequent generations as a tribute to her Aberdeen heritage. She lived in the Shoals area, where the Whitten family had a significant presence in Lauderdale County, Alabama.

=== Death and Burial ===

Martha survived her husband Jesse P. Whitten, who died on '''30 June 1882''' and was buried in Lauderdale County, Alabama. Her exact death date is not explicitly recorded in available sources, though family records indicate she passed away in the Lauderdale County, Alabama area. Researchers seeking to confirm her final resting place should consult Lauderdale County cemetery records, particularly looking for a headstone adjacent to Jesse P. Whitten's grave.
