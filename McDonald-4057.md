== Biography ==

Palina Altimira McDonald, known affectionately to her family as "Kitty," was born on March 31, 1859, at Wayland Springs in Lawrence County, Tennessee. She was the fourth of ten children born to Thomas Anderson McDonald (1822-1885), a blacksmith, and Sarah A. Adkinson (c.1825-1901). Her distinctive middle name, "Altimira" (sometimes spelled "Altina"), was chosen in honor of her aunt, Artimena McDonald English, following a family naming tradition that would continue through subsequent generations.

=== Clan Donald Heritage and Family Origins ===

Palina's lineage was deeply rooted in the Scots-Celtic heritage of Clan Donald, one of the most powerful Highland clans of Scotland. Her paternal grandparents, John McDonald (c.1792-c.1860) and Margaret Emory (c.1793-c.1880), were part of the great southern migration pattern that shaped early American settlement.

==== The McDonald Migration ====

The family's journey to Alabama followed the classic Migration Patterns of the South:

* South Carolina Origins (c.1792-1816): John McDonald was born in South Carolina around 1792
* Tennessee Settlement (1816-1834): The family relocated to Bedford County, Tennessee, during the economic depression of 1816 that drove many South Carolinians westward
* Alabama Arrival (1834): John and Margaret settled at Green Hill, Lauderdale County, Alabama, on Cow Pen Creek with their growing family

According to family historian William Lindsey England, the McDonalds likely followed the migration route: crossing the Savannah River near Anderson, South Carolina, traveling through Athens, Georgia, to Chattanooga, then down the Tennessee River to the mouth of Elk River, before settling in the Green Hill and Cloverdale areas of Alabama.

=== Family's Blacksmith and Gunsmith Heritage ===

Palina's father, Thomas Anderson McDonald, was a skilled blacksmith. The McDonald family, however, had a broader tradition of technical craftsmanship that extended to gunsmithing through several of Thomas's relatives and kinsmen. The McDonald men were renowned for producing "Kentucky Rifles," a craft that connected them to the famous Kennedy Gun Factory at Green Hill, a significant center of rifle-making in the region.

==== Family Connection to the Gun-Making Legacy ====

While Thomas Anderson focused on his blacksmith trade, several of Palina's uncles and relatives specialized in the gun-making trade:

* Multiple McDonalds purchased gun-making tools from the 1843 estate sale of Ephraim B. McDonald, a noted gunsmith at Green Hill
* The family worked closely with the Kennedy rifle tradition, producing firearms known for their quality and craftsmanship
* This technical skill represented not just a trade, but a vital contribution to frontier defense and settlement

The blacksmith and gunsmith skills were passed through generations of the family, representing both economic stability and community importance in frontier Alabama.

=== Early Life and Family Context ===

During Palina's early childhood (1859-1870), the family resided in Wayne and Lawrence Counties, Tennessee, where her father Thomas Anderson operated his blacksmith shop. The family then participated in another migration, moving to the Cypress Creek area of Lauderdale County, Alabama by 1870, where they settled near Thomas Anderson's brother, John Scruggs McDonald.

==== The Cypress Creek Community ====

The Cypress Creek settlement represented a reunion of sorts for the McDonald clan. The area featured:

* Brandon Factory (later called Embree Factory), possibly operated by relatives of Margaret Emory McDonald
* A general store operated by two Emory brothers, remembered by later generations
* An early railroad connecting iron ore mines at Iron City, Tennessee, to Florence, Alabama
* Railroad Methodist Church, named for this early railway

Young Palina grew up in this frontier community where blacksmithing, farming, and gun-making supported the family economy.

=== Census and Surname Variations ===

Genealogical researchers should note an important historical quirk: the McDonald family was frequently recorded as "McDaniel" in official records, particularly in:

* 1850 Lauderdale County, Alabama Census
* 1860 Lawrence County, Tennessee Census

This spelling variation, likely due to census-taker error or accent interpretation, is significant because, according to Celtic genealogy, McDonalds and McDaniels share common roots in the great Clan Donald. Family historians researching this line should search under both surnames to capture complete records.

=== Marriage to William M. "Bill" England ===

On November 29, 1876, at age 17, Palina married [[England-1361 | William M. "Bill" England]] (March 1, 1853 – March 6, 1905) at the residence of her father, Thomas A. McDonald, in Lauderdale County, Alabama. This marriage united two families with deep roots in the settlement of North Alabama.

==== The Family Homestead ====

A 1908 photograph (taken three years after Bill's death) shows the England family farm near Rhodesville. The homestead featured:

* A story-and-a-half structure with traditional frontier architecture
* A full front porch spanning the width of the house
* A picket fence surrounding the property
* Working farmland supporting the large family

This homestead represented Palina's domain for over three decades as she raised eight children and managed the household economy.

=== Children and Family Life ===

Palina and William raised eight children over a span of 25 years (1877-1902):

1. [[England-1364 | Ella (England) James]] (September 17, 1877 – October 30, 1910)
   * Married [[James-31739 | Robert James]]
   * Died young at age 33

   * Later married Levi Hurst
   * Lived to age 91

   * Married [[Glasscock-203 | Daisy Violet Glasscock]]
   * Died at Benton, Kentucky
   * The youngest of Palina's children

=== Widowhood and Later Life ===

William England died on March 6, 1905, at age 52, leaving Palina a widow at age 45 with several children still at home. The 1908 family photograph shows Palina managing the farm and household in the years following her husband's death, demonstrating the resilience and independence for which she was remembered.

During her widowhood, Palina continued to live in the Rhodesville/Oakland area of Lauderdale County, near her son Ed England's farm. She witnessed the marriages of her children, the arrival of grandchildren, and the transformation of rural Alabama through the early decades of the 20th century.

=== Character and Legacy ===

Family oral history, preserved by relatives including William Lindsey England and Lois Marveline England Henderson, describes Palina as embodying the "temper, resolve, and independence" characteristic of her Highland ancestors. These traits, attributed to her Scots-Celtic heritage, were remembered by her descendants as defining characteristics.

==== The Clan Donald Spirit ====

Palina represented the continuation of Clan Donald values in the New World:

* Independence: Managing a farm and family during widowhood
* Resolve: Persevering through the loss of two young children and her husband
* Family Pride: Maintaining connections to the McDonald heritage and naming traditions
* Community Standing: Respected as a matriarch in the Rhodesville/Oakland community

==== A Bridge Between Generations ====

As family historian William Lindsey England wrote, Palina acted as "a vital bridge" in family history:

* Born in the springs of Tennessee (Wayland Springs, 1859)
* Rooted in the fields of Alabama (Lauderdale County, 1870s-1936)
* Connected the rugged craftsmanship of her blacksmith and gunsmith father
* To a new generation of Alabama farmers, conservationists, and civic leaders

Through her son Ed England and other children, Palina's legacy extended well into the 20th century, connecting the frontier era to modern times.

=== The Naming Tradition ===

The name "Altimira" (and its variations "Altina" and "Artimena") represents an interesting family tradition:

* Palina was named for her aunt, Artimena McDonald English
* The name recurred through generations of the family
* Her children and grandchildren continued this naming pattern
* This practice reflects Celtic custom of honoring family members through names

This tradition helps genealogists trace family connections and demonstrates the strong family bonds maintained across generations.

=== Death and Burial ===

Palina Altimira "Kitty" McDonald England passed away on August 5, 1936, at age 77. She was laid to rest at Wesley Chapel United Methodist Church Cemetery near Cloverdale, Alabama, in the community where the McDonald family had established deep roots over seven decades earlier.

Her grave lies in the same general area where:

* Her father Thomas Anderson McDonald had operated his blacksmith shop
* Her uncle John Scruggs McDonald had farmed
* Multiple generations of McDonalds and Englands had built lives and community

=== Historical Context ===

Palina's life (1859-1936) spanned a remarkable period of American history:

* Born: Two years before the Civil War began
* Childhood: Reconstruction era in the South
* Marriage: 1876, the year Reconstruction officially ended
