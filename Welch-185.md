{{1776 Sticker|rank=Major|unit=Hamilton's Regiment, Royal British Army of North Carolina}}

== Biography ==

'''Major Nicholas Welch''' was born between 1738 and 1740 in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and died December 1814 in Giles County, Tennessee. He was a colonial American who chose to remain loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolution, serving as a Major in the Royal British Army of North Carolina.

=== Origins and Ancestry ===

Nicholas Welch was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania to '''John Welch''' and '''Elizabeth Whiteside''', who were married on 6 February 1738 in Quittapahilla, Pennsylvania.<ref>Pennsylvania Marriage Records. Harrisburg, PA: Pennsylvania Archives Printed Series, 1876. Series 2, Series 6.</ref> His upbringing in this well-established colonial region positioned him within the prosperous colonial society that would eventually be torn apart by revolutionary conflict.

=== Military Service for the Crown ===

Between 1778 and 1780, Welch served as a Major in the Royal British Army of North Carolina, representing one of many colonists who actively supported the British cause during the American Revolution. His role extended beyond battlefield service; he was an accomplished recruiter for the Loyalist cause.

According to historical accounts, Welch appeared in his community dressed in a new uniform and displaying considerable gold coins, representing himself as Major of Hamilton's Regiment. He actively recruited his neighbors, arguing:

''"The fall of Charleston, Buford's defeat, and the bad condition of affairs for the Americans everywhere."''<ref>Sketches of Western North Carolina Illustrating Principally the Revolutionary Period of Mecklenburg, Rowan, Lincoln and Adjoining Counties; as cited in The American Revolution in North Carolina: The Battle of Ramsour's Mill.</ref>

Through his persuasive narratives and strategic use of financial incentives, he successfully recruited men to the Loyalist cause. He participated in the '''Battle of Ramsour's Mill''' on 20 June 1780, a significant engagement fought entirely between Loyalist and Patriot militias in North Carolina.<ref>"History of the Battle at Ramsour's Mill."

=== Marriages and Family ===

'''First Marriage:''' Nicholas Welch married '''Elizabeth E. Moore''' (1740–1799) in North Carolina in 1757.<ref>Ancestry.com. Global, Find a Grave Index for Burials at Sea and other Select Burial Locations, 1300s-Current; Memorial ID 234100609.</ref> They had at least fifteen children:

* John Welch
* William C. Welch
* Judith Welch
* Nicholas William Welch
* Mary Welch
* Margaret E. Welch
* Thomas Welch (1st)
* Sarah Welch
* Ann Welch
* Hester Welch (1st)
* John Welch (2nd)
* Richard Welch
* Hester Welch (2nd)
* Thomas Welch (2nd)
* Elizabeth Welch
* Lewis Welch

'''Second Marriage:''' '''Nicholas Welsh''' (alternate spelling) married '''Sarah Farren''' on 26 December 1794 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<ref>Ancestry.com. Pennsylvania, U.S., Compiled Marriage Records, 1700-1821 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2011. Marriage of Nicholas Welsh to Sarah Farren, 26 Dec 1794, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</ref> This marriage has been corroborated by probate records, as discussed below.

=== Final Years and Death ===

Following the Revolutionary War, Welch relocated to frontier Tennessee. He is documented on the '''1812 Tax List for Giles County, Tennessee''', establishing his last known residence in that county.<ref>Tennessee Genealogical Records Repository, Giles County, TN Miscellaneous Genealogical Notes.</ref>

'''Death and Probate:''' Official probate records provide definitive evidence of Welch's death and location. On '''8 December 1814''', the Giles County Court Minutes record:

''"Ordered letters of adm. of est. of Nicholas WELCH, dec'd, issue to Sarah WELCH, she having qualified."''<ref>Tennessee Genealogical Records Repository, Giles County, TN Cty. Ct. Min., p. 303.</ref>

Subsequent court orders appointed commissioners to allot provisions for '''Sarah WELCH, widow of the late Nicholas WELCH''', definitively establishing his death in Giles County, Tennessee by December 1814, and identifying his second wife, Sarah Farren Welch, as his surviving widow.

=== Research Notes ===

'''Resolution of Conflicting Records:''' Earlier genealogical aggregations listed Welch's death in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, between 1810 and 1820. However, primary source evidence from both tax records and probate documents firmly establishes Giles County, Tennessee as his actual final residence and place of death. The apparent contradiction between his first and second marriages is resolved by the probate record, which identifies Sarah as his widow—confirming the 1794 Philadelphia marriage to Sarah Farren as his second marriage, which occurred after the documented death of his first wife, Elizabeth, in 1799.
