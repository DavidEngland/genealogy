== Biography ==

'''William Edward "Ed" England''' (17 Dec 1879 – 29 Feb 1964) was a respected farmer and conservationist in the Oakland community of Lauderdale County, Alabama. He was the second of eight children of [[England-1361|William M. "Bill" England]] and [[McDonald-4057|Palina Altimira "Kitty" McDonald]], blending a paternal line of South Carolina/Tennessee migrants with a maternal line of Clan Donald craftsmen and Shoals gunsmiths.

Ed grew up in a family where traditional skills and trades were highly valued. The England family, of which he was a part, had deep roots in the early American frontier, with his ancestors being among the early settlers in the region. This heritage instilled in him a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for the land.

In his early years, Ed helped his father, a farmer and blacksmith, in their fields and shop, learning the value of hard work and self-reliance. The skills he acquired during these formative years would serve him well throughout his life, both as a farmer and as a community leader.

=== Marriage and Family ===

On '''19 December 1909''', Ed married '''[[Parish-370|Nancy Pearl Parish]]''' at the Parish home in Oakland. Family oral history recalls it as a hurried “shotgun” wedding officiated by her father, '''William Archabald "Squire" Parish''', Justice of the Peace, with sister-in-law Edith playing a $12 Sears & Roebuck pump organ.<ref>Florence Herald (weekly), late Dec 1909, “England–Parish” marriage announcement.</ref><ref name="oral">England family oral history (David England), “Squire” Parish JP and Sears & Roebuck organ.</ref>

# '''William Berlin England''' (1913–1990s)
# '''Lois Marveline England''' (1914–?) – librarian/educator and family historian

=== Farm, Conservation, and Community ===

Ed and Nancy first lived at Rhodesville, then settled in Oakland, operating sizeable holdings in Burcham Valley and Oakland. They ran two large chicken houses supplying eggs to local markets and practiced sustainable methods such as the “Three Sisters” intercropping (corn, beans, squash). His careful land stewardship reflected the precision of his blacksmith/gunsmith forebears and preserved soil and water resources for later generations.

=== Death and Burial ===

Ed died on '''29 February 1964''' at Florence ECM Hospital and was buried at '''New Hope Church of Christ Cemetery''' near Central Heights, on land originally donated by his wife’s grandmother, Rachael Emily Haddock.<ref>"Alabama, Deaths, 1908-1974," FamilySearch.</ref>
