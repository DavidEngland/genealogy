The genealogy of the **Gresham family** (often spelled **Grisham**) is rooted in 17th-century English immigration and characterized by significant roles in the early development of Maryland and Virginia.

### **The Founding Patriarch: John Gresham**
The lineage in America begins with **John Gresham**, the immigrant, who was born in England in 1613. He was the son of **Sir Edward Gresham of Titsey** and Mary Clarke. John emigrated to America at age 22, embarking on the ship *Thomas* on August 21, 1635; his brother **Edward Gresham** also emigrated that same year.

John’s early life in the colonies was marked by both land acquisition and political turmoil:
*   **Maryland Settlement:** In 1640, he was granted 100 acres on the **Isle of Kent, Maryland**, a plantation known as "Beaver Neck".
*   **Political Rebellion:** He was an active participant in the **Claiborne and Ingle Rebellions** against the Maryland Proprietary Government. Because he "chose the wrong side" in these power struggles, a warrant for his arrest as a **"Rebell"** was issued in 1648, and his Maryland lands were forfeited.
*   **Move to Virginia:** Following his displacement from Maryland, John moved to **Northumberland County, Virginia**. In 1652, he signed the Northumberland Oath of Allegiance to the Commonwealth of England and was granted **520 acres of land**.
*   **Family and Death:** John died intestate around February 1655. He likely married twice, his second wife being a widow named **Mary Playce**. His children included a son, John (Jr.), and daughters Mary, Martha (who married Richard Flynt), and Katherine (who married Justinian Tennis), as well as a son named Justinian who died as a minor.

### **The Harris Grisham Lineage**
A prominent later branch of the family is traced to **Harris Gresham (Grisham), Sr.**, born circa 1750 in Orange County, North Carolina.
*   **Military Service:** He served in the **Continental Army** during the Revolutionary War under **General Francis Marion**.
*   **Westward Migration:** In 1794, Harris moved his family to Sumner County, Tennessee, eventually settling in **Smith County, Tennessee**.
*   **Descendants:** His children included Harris Jr., Peter, Davis, Joseph, and Nelly. His son **Davis Grisham** (1781–1872) later moved the family to **Pope County, Illinois**, in 1832. Davis and his wife, Sarah "Sally" Gregory, had **thirteen children**, establishing a large branch of the family in the Midwest.

### **Notable Figures and Genealogical Research**
Modern Gresham genealogy has been preserved through the work of several key individuals:
*   **Dr. Perry Epler Gresham (1907–1994):** The President Emeritus of Bethany College was a devoted family historian who wrote extensively about his ancestor **Sir Thomas Gresham** (1519–1579).
*   **Genealogical Preservation:** In the late 20th century, research was consolidated through the newsletter **"Gresham, Any Way You Spell It,"** edited by **Carol Grisham Byrom**. This publication aimed to document the various spellings of the name and verify records against original courthouse documents.

**Analogy for the Gresham Family History:**
If family history is a **navigational chart**, the Gresham lineage is a **series of bold course corrections**; from the aristocratic estates of Titsey, England, to the rebellious shores of Maryland, and finally into the frontiers of Virginia, Tennessee, and Illinois, each generation successfully recalculated its path to find new land and opportunity.
