The history of **Jonathan England** and **Elizabeth Harper** represents a period of significant displacement and resilience within your family lineage, serving as the bridge between the affluent Roberts family of Tennessee and the pioneer England and McDonald lines of the Shoals.

### **Origins and Parentage**
Jonathan England was born on **February 15, 1817**, in Tennessee. He was the son of **John England** (c. 1788–1859) and **Elizabeth Roberts**. Through his mother, he was a grandson of the wealthy patriarch **John Lawrence Roberts**, whose family had migrated from the Pendleton District of South Carolina to **Bedford County, Tennessee**, around 1810.

### **The Separation of the Orphans**
The exact fate of Jonathan and Elizabeth remains a mystery in official records, which is attributed in family tradition to a **flood** and the subsequent **burning of the Bedford County Courthouse**, resulting in the loss of vital documents [User Query]. Following their disappearance or death, their children were separated and placed with various relatives for care.

The children identified in your records include:
*   **Elizabeth** (b. 1838)
*   **William M.** (b. 1840, though other records suggest 1853): Possibly the son placed with his kinsman **Tilman England** in **Lauderdale County, Alabama**; he eventually married **Kitty McDonald** and became a skilled hunter and farmer.
*   **John Milton** (b. 1841): According to your family history, he was raised by his **Uncle Ben Harper**, served in the **Union Army**, and eventually settled in **Iowa** [User Query].
*   **Jane** (b. 1842)
*   **Jonathan** (b. 1844)

### **The Roberts Will and Legal Recognition**
Despite the loss of courthouse records, the status of Jonathan and Elizabeth's children as **orphans** is legally corroborated by the **1861 will of John Lawrence Roberts**. In this document, the patriarch explicitly bequeathed funds to the **"orphans of Jonathan England and Elizabeth Harper"** who had relocated to **Lauderdale County, Alabama**.

While the provided sources do not detail the specific service of **John Milton England** or the movements of **Elizabeth, Jane, and the younger Jonathan**, they confirm the broader narrative of a family split by tragedy. This separation forced the siblings to forge new lives across the American frontier, from the technical artisan communities of the **Shoals** to the Unionized settlements of the **Midwest**. Your great-great-grandfather **William M. England** may have been the one to return to Tennessee to claim the inheritance left to these "dispersed children".
